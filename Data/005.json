These seeds taste and look like amse seeds only they are larger, plumper, and milder. They give meat and vegetables a delicious, liquorice like flavour. They may be bought from some supermarkets and all Indian and Pakistani grocers. Indians often serve roasted fennel seeds at the end of a meal as a digestive and mouth freshener. This is an aromatic mixture that generally incorporates spices which are supposed to heat the body (the words mean 'hot spices') such as large black cardamoms, cinnamon, black cumin (also called shah zeera or royal cumin), cloves, black peppercorns and nutmeg. The mixture is used sparingly and is generally put into foods towards the end of their cooking period. It is also used as a garnish - a final aromatic flavouring sprinkled over cooked meats, vegetables and pulses. Garam masala is not a standardized spice mixture. Apart from the fact that there are many regional variations, I am sure that every North Indian and Pakistani home has its own family recipe. The recipe here happens to be one of my favourites. I have substituted seeds from the green cardamom pods for the more traditional black ones as I find their taste to be far more delicate.

It is best to grind garam masafa in small quantities so that it stays fresh. My recipe makes about 3 tablespoons.

It is available in all supermarkets. This light brown, knobbly 'root' is not a root at all but a rhizome with a refreshing, pungent flavour. Its potato-like skin needs to be peeled away before it can be chopped, sliced, grated, or made into a paste. To grate ginger into a pulp, use the finest part of a hand grater. To grind ginger into a paste, chop it coarsely first and then throw it into the container of a food processor or blender. Add just enough water to make as smooth a paste as possible.

It is certainly sold by all Asian grocers. When buying ginger, look for pieces that are not too wrinkled but have a taut skin. If you use ginger infrequently, 'store' ginger by planting it in a somewhat dry, sand y soil. Water it infrequentl y. Your ginger will not only survive, but will also sprout fresh knobs. Whenever you need some, dig it up, break off a knob, and then plant the rest again. If you use ginger frequently, store it in a cool, airy basket, along with your onions, potatoes, and garlic. This spice is a small, black, teardrop shaped onion seed with an appealing, earthy aroma. It is used for cooking vegetable and fish dishes in Bengal. The rest of the country uses it for pickling. Some north Indian breads such as naans have these seeds sprinkled on them before they are baked. Ka!onji is sold in Indian and Pakistani stores. This yellow oil made from mustard seeds is quite pungent when raw and amazingl y sweet when heated to a slight haze. It is used in Bengal and Kashmir for cooking vegetables and fish. It is the favourite oil throughout India for pickling. It is available only at Indian and Pakistani grocers. If you cannot find it, ground-nut oil may be substituted. Once you start using these seeds, you will not want to stop. They are round, tiny, and not really black but a dark reddish-brown colour. When scattered into hot oil they turn deliciously nutty.

Saffron threads are the stigma of special crocuses that, in India, grow in the northern state of Kashmir. Saffron is expensive. It is used in festive dishes both for its saffron colour and its aroma. Yellow food colouring, or a small pinch of turmeric, may be substituted for the real thing even though purists would disapprove. To get the most colour and flavour out of saffron, Indians often roast the threads lightly in a heavy cast-iron frying pan and then crumble them into a small amount of hot milk. T his milk is then poured into rice and meat dishes as well as desserts. Saffron is sold in some supermarkets, all fi ne delicatessens and most Indian and Pakistani groceries.

This airy, real silver tissue is used for garnishing sweets as well as festive meat and rice dishes. It is sold only at some Indian and Pakistani grocers. Each silver tissue is packed between sheets of paper. Remove the top sheet carefully. Then pick up the next sheet with the vark on it and overturn it gently on the food you wish to garnish. Try not to let the vark disintegrate. It is edible. Store it in a tightly closed tin as it can tarnish. Most of my recipes call, rather generally, for vegetable oil. You could use what is labelled as vegetable oil in the supermarkets or you could use ground-nut oil, corn oil or sunflower oil. All would be quite suitable. These are used on some Indian foods - for instance these give Tandoori food its distinct- ive colouring. They are vegetable colourings and have no taste. However, one word of warning: a few people (and that includes me!) are allergic to the tartrazine contained in these colourings. 22 SPICES, SEASONING AND FLAVOURINGS TECHNIQUES 23 -------------------------- I ndian food is unique in its imaginative use of spices, seasonings, and flavourings. Many of our cooking techniques are really ways of getting these same spices, seasonings and flavourings to yield as great a variety of tastes and textures as possible. Spices and herbs do not have single, limited tastes. Depending upon how they are used - whole, ground, roasted, fried - they can be coaxed into producing a much larger spectrum than you might first imagine. Herein lies the genius oflndian cooking. It amuses me to find that many of the techniques used in the 'Nouvelle Cuisine' of France have been used in India for centuries. We are told that sauces can be made much lighter if they are thickened with ingredients other than flour. Flour is almost never used as a thickener for Indian sauces. Instead, we have used, very cleverly, I might add, ingredients such as onions, garlic, ginger, yoghurt and tomatoes. I think it might be useful, before you actually start cooking a recipe from this book, to measure and prepare all the ingredients you need for the recipe and have them ready near the cooker. Once you are experienced, this will not matter as much. But for those of you who are new to Indian cookery, it will help if you make all your pastes and do all your chopping and measuring before you start. The reason for this is that many Indian dishes require you to cook in one, flowing sweep. Ingredient follows ingredient, often swiftly. Frequently there is no time to stop and hunt for a spice that is hidden in the back of a cupboard. Something on the cooker might burn if you do. So organize yourself and read the recipe carefully. If many of the ingredients go into the pot at the same time, you can measure them out and keep them in the same bowl or plate. Here are some of the more commonly used techniques: 24 TECHNIQUES Clarified butter Ghee Dropping spices into hot oil Baghaar Not all Indian food is cooked in ghee, as some people imagine. Many of our foods are meant to be cooked in vegetable oil. But ghee does have a rich, nutty taste and a spoonful of it is frequently put on top of cooked pulses to enrich them and give them a silky smoothness. I must add here that there are certain families in India (not ours) who have always cooked in ghee. There used to be a certain amount of status attached to being able to say, 'We use nothing but pure ghee.' But today, even these families are coming around to using unsatu- rated fats. I feel that cooking in ghee is a bit like cooking in butter. It is fine to do it some of the time for certain selected dishes. Some of my recipes do call for ghee. I suggest you buy it, ready-made, from Asian grocers. However, if you wish to make it yourself, melt a pound of unsalted butter in a small, heavy pot over a low flame. Then let it simmer very gently for 10- 30 minutes. The length of the time will depend upon the amount of water in the butter. As soon as the white, milky residue turns to golden particles (you have to keep watching), strain the ghee through several layers of cheesecloth or a large handkerchief. Cool and then pour into a clean jar. Cover. Properly made ghee does not need refrigeration. I do not know of this technique being used anywhere else in the world. Oil (or ghee) is heated until it is extremely hot, but not burning. Then spices, generally whole ones, or else chopped up garlic and ginger, are added to the oil. The seasonings immediately begin to swell, brown, pop, or otherwise change character. This seasoned oil, together with all the spices in it, is then poured over cooked foods such as pulses and vegetables or TECHNIQUES 2 5 Grinding spices 26 TECHN IQUES else uncooked foods are added to it and then sauteed or simmered. The seasonings that are most commonly used for baghaar include whole cumin seeds, whole black mustard seeds, whole fenn el seeds, whole dried red chillies, whole cloves, cinnamon sticks, car- damom pods, bay leaves, black peppercorns, as well as chopped up garlic and ginger. Hot oil transforms them all and gives them a new, more concentrated character. When the whole spices used are large, such as bay leaves, cinnamon sticks or even cloves and pepper- corns, they are not meant to be eaten but are left to one side of the plate along with any bones. Many recipes call for ground spices. In India, we generally buy our spices whole and then grind them ourselves as we need them. They have much more fla vour this way. You probably already know the difference between freshly ground black pepper and ground pepper that has been sitting around for a month. The same applies to all spices. In India, the grinding of spices is generally done on heavy grinding stones. We, in our modern kitchens, can get the same results without the labour by using an electric coffee-grinder. It is best to grind limited quantities so that the spices do not lose their flavour. If you wipe the grinder carefully after use there will be no 'aftertaste' of spices to flavour your coffee beans. Buying ground spices is perfectly all right as long as you know that they will be less potent as time goes on. Before buying your spices, consult the preceding chapter to see which spices you must buy whole and which you may buy ground. Roasting spices Making thick sauces T his brings out yet another flavour from the spices. In my home, for example, we always make yoghurt relishes with cumin that has been roasted first and then ground. Nothing else will do. Ordinary ground cumin has a different flavour, quite unsuitable for putting into foods that are not going to be cooked. This roasting is best done in a heavy, cast iron frying pan since the pan can be heated without putting oil or water into it first. Whole spices are put into the pan. The pan is then shaken around until the spices turn a shade or two darker and emit their new 'roasted' aroma. You will begin to recognise it after you have done it a few times. Many of our meat, poultry, and fish dishes have thick, dark sauces. M y mother always said that the mark of a good chef was his sauce which depended not only on a correct balance of all the ingredients, but the correct frying (bhuno-ing) of these ingredients. As I stated earlier, there is no flour in these sauces. The 'body' comes, very often, from onions, garlic and ginger. The rich brown colour comes from frying all these ingredients properly. Very often, we make a paste of one or more of these ingredients first. In India, this is done on a grinding stone but in western kitchens it can be done easily in food processors and blenders, sometimes with the aid of a little water. Once the paste has been made, it needs to be browned or the sauce will not have the correct fla vour and colour. This is best done in a heavy pot, preferably non-stick, in a generous amount of oil. Remember that extra oil can always be spooned off the top once the dish has been cooked. TECHNIQUES 27 Browning sliced or chopped onions and garlic Adding yoghurt to sauces 28 TECHN IQ ES Sometimes a recipe requires that you brown thinly sliced or chopped onions. I have noticed that many of the students in my cookery classes stop half-way and when I point out to them that the onions are not quite done, they say 'Oh, but if we cook them more, they will burn. ' They will not, not if you watch. Start the frying on a medium-high flame and turn the heat down somewhat as the onions lose their water and begin to turn brown. They do need to be a rich reddish-brown colour or your sauce - if that is what they are intended for - will be pale and weak. The same goes for garlic. There is a common misconception that if garlic is allowed to pick up any colour at all, it will turn bitter. Actually, garlic tastes quite superb if it is chopped and allowed to fry in oil until it turns a medium-brown colour. I often cook courgettes this way - in oil that has been fla voured with browned garlic. Spinach and cauliflower tastes good this way too. In India, we say that such dishes are cooked with a garlic baghaar. A garlic baghaar can, of course, just be the first step in a recipe. More spices would be added later. Yoghurt adds a creamy texture and a delicate tartness to many of our sauces. But yoghurt curdles when it is heated. So when we add it to our browning sauces, we add just a tablespoon at a time. After a tablespoon of yoghurt has been put in, it is stirred and fried until it is absorbed and 'accepted' by the sauce. Then the next tablespoon is added. Peeling and chopping tomatoes Reducing sauces Cooking chicken without its skin Marinading Browning meats Many of my recipes call for peeled and chopped tomatoes. To peel them, bring a pot of water to a rolling boil. Drop in the tomatoes for I 5 seconds. Drain, rinse under cold water and peel. Now chop the tomatoes, making sure that you save all the juice that comes out of them. In India, we very rarely seed tomatoes. Many people do not even bother to peel them though I do feel that this improves the texture of a sauce. Sometimes meat is allowed to cook in a fairly thin, brothy sauce. Then the lid of the pot is removed and the sauce reduced over a fairly high flame until it is thick and clings to the meat. The meat has to be stirred frequently at this stage, so that it does not catch and burn. In India, we almost always remove the skin of the chicken before we cook it. The flavour of the spices penetrates the chicken much better this way and the entire dish is less fatty. It is very easy to remove the skin. Just hold it with kitchen paper so that it does not slip, and pull! We often cut deep gashes in large pieces of meat and leave them overnight in a marinade of yoghurt and seasonings. The yoghurt tenderises the meat while the gashes allow the flavour to penetrate deep inside the meat. After this, the meat can be grilled or baked faster than usual. In India, we generally do not brown cubes of meat by themselves but brown them with the sauce instead. I find this hard to do with British meats because they release far too much water as they cook. Indian meats tend to TECHNIQUES 29 --------- - -------- be very fresh and have far less water in them. So to avoid this problem I brown my meat a few pieces at a time in hot oil and set them aside. Once I have made the sauce, I add the browned meat cubes (and all the good juices that come out of them) and let them cook. These are just a few of the techniques that we use in Indian cookery. Others, that have to do with cooking rice or pulses, I shall deal with in later chapters. 30 TECHNIQUES MENUS AND HOW TO EAT INDIAN FOOD JI Wat do you eat with what? With each recipe in this book, I have suggested a menu. You do not have to follow it. After all, the fun of eating is to follo w your own palate and put together dishes that are con venient and exciting for you. G enerall y speaking, an Indian meal consists of a meat dish, a vegetable dish, bread and/or rice, a pulse dish, a yoghurt relish (or plain yoghurt), and a fresh chutney or small, relish-like salad . Pickles and preserved chutneys may be added if you have them. Fruit, rather than desserts are served at the end of a meal, although on festive occasions, sweets would not be at all amiss. Sometimes, when the meat dish is particularly elegant and rich, we eliminate th e pulse and serve an equally elegant pullao rice. Vegetarians - of whom there are millions in India - increase the number of vegetable and pulse dishes and always serve yoghurt in some form. W ithin this general framework, we try to see that the dishes we serve vary in colour, texture, and flavour. If the meat, for example, has a lot of sauce, then we often serve a 'dry', unsauced vegetable with it. If the vegetable we are serving is very soft - such as spinach - we make sure that there is a crunchy relish around on the table. M ost Indians like to eat with their hands. The more Westernised ones may use knives and forks or spoons and forks, or just forks, but they too succumb every now and then to the pleasure of eating with their fingers. It is only the right hand that is used for eating, the left being considered ' unclean'. W ith it, we break pieces of bread and then use the pieces to scoop up some meat or vegetable. W ith it, we also form neat morsels out of rice and other accompanying dishes and then transport them to our mouths. In the northern states such as U ttar Pradesh, this is done very delicately with just the tips of the fingers. In the south, almost the entire hand may be used. eedless to say, hands must be washed before and after eating. Even the humblest of roadside stalls catering to simple villagers and truck drivers would not consider offering food before offering a Iota (water vessel) of water for washing first. When we serve ourselves, we put most food s beside each other on our plates. Only very wet, flowing dishes are sometimes ladled on top of the rice but not on top of all the rice. Some of the rice is left plain to enable us to eat it with other dishes. Very wet dishes that are meant to be eaten with bread are served in small, individual bowls.

If you feel like making such a meal, then by all means, do it. On the other hand, there is no reason why you cannot serve an Indian vegetable with your roast lamb or eat an Indian meat (such as 'Chicken in a butter sauce', page 70) with French bread and a salad. If you are on a diet, you could make yourself a 'Yoghurt with cucumber and fresh mint' (page 162) for lunch and follow it with a crunchy apple. I have even served a roast leg of lamb with 'Black-eyed beans and mushrooms' (page 128), 'Simple buttery rice with onions' (page 149), and a green salad. It is an easy meal to put together and it is good. The colour photographs in this book show combinations of recipes to serve together for a variety of meals.

For those of you who already have a well equipped kitchen, the answer is probably 'no'. Good knives, sturdy pots with a good distribution of heat, rolling pins, graters, bowls, slotted spoons, pestle and mortar, frying pans - I am sure you have these already. There are, however, a few items that make the cooking of Indian food simpler. 38 EQU IPMENT An electric food processor or blender An electric coffee grinder Tongs Every Indian home has a grinding stone. This consists of a large flat stone that just sits and a smaller stone that is moved manually on top of it and does the actual grinding. These stones are exceedingly heavy. It is just as well that they are no longer essential. Their place, in modern kitchens, can be taken by food processors and blenders. Onions, garlic and ginger, formerly ground on grinding stones, can now be made into a paste in electrically powered machines. If you do not have a food processor or blender, then there are ways around it. Garlic, for example, may be mashed in a mortar or put through a garlic press. Ginger may be grated on the finest part of the grater. Onions can just be chopped very finely. Sometimes my recipe suggests putting water into the food processor while making the paste. If you have crushed the garlic and grated the ginger by hand, just put them into a bowl and add the amount of water in the recipe. If you decide to go out and buy a blender, make sure that its blades sit close to the bottom. Otherwise it will not pulverise small quantities adequately. Food processors and blenders cannot do all the work of an Indian grinding stone. Dry spices, for example, cannot be ground in them properly. For this, only a coffee-grinder will do. A coffee-grinder grinds spices in seconds and can then be wiped clean. If you do not have one, you will have to crush your spices in small quantities with a pestle and mortar. My favourite tongs are intended for barbecues but I use them for turning chicken pieces, picking up meat pieces when they are browning, and even for tossing a salad. EQUIPMENT 39 A large non-stick frying pan with a lid Small and large cast-iron frying pans Karhai Electric Rice Cookers 40 EQUIPMENT Non-stick pans really take the worry out of cooking many foods. Browning meats do not stick to the bottom, nor do sauces with ginger or almonds. As metal spoons ruin the finish of non-stick utensils, it is best to have a set of plastic or wooden ones. I keep a 5 inch (13 em) cast-iron frying pan for roasting spices - it can heat without oil or water in it - and for doing baghaar, frying small amounts of spices in oil. A larger cast- iron pan is excellent for making Indian breads such as parathas and chapatis. In India, these breads are cooked on a tava, a round, concave cast-iron plate. A large cast-iron frying pan makes the best substitute. This is very similar to a Chinese wok. If you took a large, hollow ball and cut it into half, that would be about the shape of a karhai. I am not suggesting that you go out and buy a karhai. I just wish to point out that for deep- frying, it is perhaps the most economical utensil as it allows you to use a relatively small quantity of oil while giving you enough depth in the centre of the utensil to submerge foods. A deep frying pan can be substituted for a karhai. If you frequently cook large quantities of rice, an electric rice cooker can be a useful piece of equipment. The cooker has a large covered pan which sits on top of an electric element. When the water has been absorbed by the rice, the cooker switches itself off, and will then keep the rice warm for several hours. The preparation of the rice and the amount of water you use are identical to the conventional methods of cooking rice (see page 144). MEAT 41 Lis chapter has a great variety of meat dishes in it, going from Kheema malar 'Minced lamb with peas' and 'Pork chops with chickpeas' that you may wish to cook for your family, to Raan masaledar - a whole leg of lamb garnished with almonds and raisins - which would impress the most blase of guests. There are a lot of lamb recipes. We do eat a fair amount oflamb in India. We also eat a lot of goat. As goat is hard to find in Britain, I have substituted lamb in its place. I love English lamb. I realise that it is a bit expensive but it does have excellent flavour. I find that the best cuts of lamb for stewing come from the neck and shoulder. Butchers have a way of trying to sell leg oflamb for stewing, mainly because it is easier to cut up. If you can, insist upon shoulder. You could buy a whole shoulder and carve up the meat yourself. Or you could buy shoulder chops and cut them up with a heavy cleaver. There is a lot of connective tissue in the shoulder and neck. This eventually makes for a moister meat. In India, we usually leave the bone in the meat when we are cooking any stew-type dish. In fact, we throw in a few extra marrow bones for good measure because they affect the taste and texture of the sauce. As children, we always fought for the marrow bones. The victor not only got to eat the marrow but to use the funny, long, silver marrow spoons that sat decoratively in the centre of our dining table. Many recipes in this book call for boned lamb. This is only because, over the years, I have seen many guests struggle with bones and have come to the conclusion that just because I like bones (I suck them), there is no reason to inflict them upon my guests. A majority of people who dine in our house seem to prefer boned meat. I leave the bone-in or bone-out decision up to you. Just remember that bones in stewing meat such as shoulder make up about 40 per cent of the total volume. If my recipe is for boned meat and you decide to leave the bone in, you might feed just half the number of people. In India, we frequently cook meat with vegetables such as potatoes and turnips. The vegetables absorb the taste of the meat and lend their own flavour to the sauce. I have included a few recipes for beef and pork as there are many communities in India which eat them.

I rarely serve the slices as I find their texture to be pathetically mushy but I do use the puree. I often chill it thoroughly and then swirl it into a bowl filled with double the amoun t of whipped cream. I then sprinkle some toasted almonds or pistachios over the top. It is a very simple dessert. Very refreshing too. Fresh mangoes are another matter. If you ever see good ones (those with a strong mango aroma), such as the alphonso from the Bombay region, do buy them. Remember, though, that many grocers sell mangoes that are not full y ripe - those that are hard to the touch - because they have a long shelf life. Such mangoes may be ripened at home. Just wrap them individually in newspaper and then put them in a covered basket or cardboard box. Leave this container in a warm place (such as the kitchen) until the mangoes are ripe. A ripe mango should yeild slightl y when pressed. After the mangoes have ripened, they should be chilled, peeled and sliced. M angoes do ha ve stones. So you have to slice around them.

Whether they are on buses, trains, cinema houses or in parks, they can be spotted opening up newspaper cones, unwrapping tea-cloth bundles or easing eager hands into terra cotta pots. Good things are hidden inside that can be nibbled upon for the satisfaction of the soul. Take samosas, for instance, those triangular, savoury pastries. The best place to eat them is right on the street, when the odours wafting from a near- by samosa-maker become too overwhelming to resist. All kinds of kebabs, marinated and grilled meat cubes, are also sold at open stalls. This is done deliberately to entice passing strollers. All workers in India stop for tea, a custom not too different from the British one. But what is served, is a bit different. T here would be tea of course, perhaps masala chai ('Spiced tea') or coffee. T hen, an odd assortment might appear - samosas, fried cashews, and, to sweeten the mouth, some carrot halva! All these dishes have been included in this chapter. T here are also snacks that may be served with drinks, such as cocktail koftas (meatballs) that lend themselves very well to having toothpicks stuck in them and spicy potato matchsticks. I have included some soups in this chapter as well. Even though we do not, as a nation drink soups, most Westernized Indians have happily adapted soups from other nations to suit their own tastes. Everyday meals in India generally end with fresh fruit - mangoes, pineapples, oranges, apples, pears, bananas, guavas, cherries, loquats, melons, jackfruit - whatever happens to be in season. F rui t is refreshing and cleansing - and a perfect conclusion to a spicy meal. In our family, my mother always peeled and cut the smaller fruit for all of us at the table. A plate was passed around and we took what we wanted. L arger, messier fruit, such as water melons, were cut in the kitchen before the meal and left to cool in the refrigerator. Desserts and sweetmeats are usually reserved for festive occasions.

The heat inside builds up to such an extent that small whole chickens, skewered and thrust into it, cook in about 10 minutes. This fierce heat seals the juices of the bird and keeps it moist while an earlier marinating process ensures that the chicken is tender and well flavoured. The result is quite spectacular. To approximate a tandoor, I use an ordinary oven, pre-heated to its maximum temperature. Then, instead of cooking a whole bird, I use serving- sized pieces - legs that are cut into two and breasts that are quartered. The cooking time is not 10 minutes because home ovens do not get as hot as tan doors. Still, breasts cook in about 15- 20 minutes and legs in 20- 25 minutes. Tandoori chicken may, of course, be served just the way it comes out of the oven with a few wedges of lemon, or it can, without much effort, be transformed into Makkhani mw'ghi (see next recipe) by smothering it with a rich butter-cream-tomato sauce. Both dishes are excellent for dinner parties as most of the work can be done a day ahead of time. The chicken is marinated the night before so all you have to do on the day of the party is to cook it in the oven for a brief 20- 25 minutes just before you sit down to eat.

This saddens me. I was brought up thinking of chicken as something special and have never managed to get over thinking so; besides, I like chicken. And there are such wonderful ways to cook it, from the simple 'Spicy baked chicken' to the elegant Makkhani murghi ('Chicken in a butter sauce') and the very impressive Murgh musallam ('Whole chicken baked in aluminium foil'). If you are on a diet, you can eat 'Tandoori chicken' which is cooked without fat and when you want to indulge yourself, you can dine on Shahjahanl murghi ('Mughlai chicken with almonds and raisins'). There are two things to remember when cooking Indian-style chicken dishes. The first is that we nearly always skin the chicken before we cook it. Skin has never been popular in India, perhaps because it gets so soft and flabby in stews. The second is that, for most of our dishes, we cut up the chicken into fairly small pieces. Legs, for example, are always separated into drumsticks and thighs. Breasts are cut into 4- 6 parts. Wings and backs are similarly cut up. When one of my recipes calls for chicken parts, you can either buy a whole 3- 3! lb (r.s- 1.75kg) chicken and cut it up yourself using a sharp knife and a cleaver or else you can buy chicken joints - the ones you prefer - and cut them up further, if necessary. I happen to have a family in which four members like dark meat and one only likes breast meat (unless it is a roast, when we all prefer breast meat). This does not make life easy. But I do have to keep everyone happy so I frequently resort to buying joints. I have a few egg recipes in this chapter as well. If you are looking for a new, spicier approach to eggs, try Ekoon·, scrambled eggs cooked with fresh green coriander and tomato or the pie-like Parsi omelette seasoned with cumin and green chillies. Indians also know how to convert plain, hard boiled eggs into the most delicious main courses by putting them into thick, creamy sauces or tart, vinegary ones. 64 CHICKEN ", "labels": ["Irrelevant"]}, "id": "05Slr0s2KI", "from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels"}, {"value": {"start": 96366, "end": 98514, "text": "Bombay-style chicken with red split lentils Murghi aur masoor dal This dish, in which chicken is combined with red lentils, is really like a hearty stew, just perfect for cold winter days.

This fierce heat seals the juices of the bird and keeps it moist while an earlier marinating process ensures that the chicken is tender and well flavoured. The result is quite spectacular. To approximate a tandoor, I use an ordinary oven, pre-heated to its maximum temperature. Then, instead of cooking a whole bird, I use serving- sized pieces - legs that are cut into two and breasts that are quartered. The cooking time is not 10 minutes because home ovens do not get as hot as tan doors. Still, breasts cook in about 15- 20 minutes and legs in 20- 25 minutes. Tandoori chicken may, of course, be served just the way it comes out of the oven with a few wedges of lemon, or it can, without much effort, be transformed into Makkhani mw'ghi (see next recipe) by smothering it with a rich butter-cream-tomato sauce. Both dishes are excellent for dinner parties as most of the work can be done a day ahead of time. The chicken is marinated the night before so all you have to do on the day of the party is to cook it in the oven for a brief 20- 25 minutes just before you sit down to eat. If you wish to make the sauce, all the ingredients for it except the butter may be combined in a bowl the day before and refrigerated.

Moong dal pancakes with peas Gujerati poore Savoury pancakes made out of split peas, or rice and split peas, provide much of India with a nourishing snack food.

Makes about 9: 6! oz (I9og) moong dal, picked over, washed, and drained 2 oz (sog) shelled peas A 1 inch (2.5cm) cube of ginger, peeled and coarsely chopped 2-3 cloves garlic, peeled 1-2 fresh, hot green chillies, cut into 4 pieces each 1 teaspoon salt i teaspoon ground turmeric 3 fl oz (7sml) plus 1 tablespoon water 2 oz (sog) onion, peeled and minced 2 tablespoons finely chopped coriander ± teaspoon baking soda About 4 fl oz (12sml) vegetable oil Put the dal in a bowl. Add If pints (1 litre) water and soak for 5 hours. Drain. Drop the peas into boiling water for 3- 4 minutes or until they are tender. Drain and chop coarsely. Combine the ginger, garlic, chillies, salt, turmeric, da/, and 3 f1 OZ ( 7 5ml) plus 1 tablespoon water in the container of an electric blender. Blend until you have a smooth batter. Let the machine run for 2- 3 minutes more so the batter gets light and airy. Empty the batter into a bowl. Add the onion and fresh coriander and peas. Mix. The batter may now be covered and refrigerated, if you like, for up to 24 hours. Just before you get ready to cook, add the baking soda and mix it in . Remember to stir the batter before you make each pancake. Brush an 8 inch (2ocm) non-stick frying pan with about 1 teaspoon of oil and set it to heat over a medium-low flame. Remove about 2 fl oz (ssml) of batter. When the oil is hot, drop this batter right in the centre of the pan. Now, place the rounded bottom of a soup spoon on the centre of the blob of batter.

Or you can start cooking rice on top of the cooker with just the amount of water needed for absorption and then finish it off in the oven. The method you choose depends upon the recipe and what you want the rice to do. If you are unsure about cooking rice, just follow my recipes carefully and you should not go wrong. There are a few things that are worth remembering when cooking rice: 1 Use a heavy pot with a very tight-fitting lid. If you have a tin-lined copper pot hanging decoratively in your kitchen, this is your chance to use it. An enamelled, cast-iron pot is also good for rice. I find that such pots generally have fairly loose-fitting lids. There is a very quick remedy for this. Just cover the pot tightly with a sheet of aluminium foil first and then with its own lid. You can also make good rice in heavy, stainless steel pots. Any time you are unsure about the fittin g of the lid, interpose a layer of aluminium foil between it and the pot. Be sure to crinkle the edges of the foil so that hardly any steam escapes. In many of my recipes, the rice ends up by cooking in steam. If too much of it escapes, the rice will not cook properly. 2 For best results, rice should be washed in several changes of water and then soaked for about 30 minutes before it is cooked. The washing gets rid of the starchy powder left over from the milling process. The soaking lets each grain absorb water so it sticks less to the next grain while it is cooking. 3 If you are cooking rice with just enough water or stock needed for absorption,", "labels": ["Relevant"]}, "id": "mmQnqof0on", "from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels"}, {"value": {"start": 229423, "end": 229472, "text": " to measure my rice in a clear measuring jug and ", "labels": ["Relevant"]}, "id": "vj7_8M7w3T", "from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels"}, {"value": {"start": 229473, "end": 231176, "text": " never use more than It parts liquid to I part rice. If I have soaked the rice, my ratio changes to I+ parts liquid to I part nee. 4 Sometimes I saute my rice before I add liquid to it. This also helps to keep the grains separate. When you saute rice, do it gently. Some type of rice grains, such as basmati, are very delicate, particularly after they have been soaked. If you saute too vigorously, the grains break up into small pieces. 5 Once I cover my rice pot with a lid, I like to cook it on a very, very low flame. If you cannot adjust your heat to this very, very low, then use an oven- I44 RI CE proof pot to begin with, cover it tightly as instructed, and pop it into a preheated gas mark 3, 325 F (170°C) oven for 25 minutes. 6 Resist any urge you may have to peep into a covered pot of rice before the cooking time is over. Precious steam will escape and the rice will cook unevenly. 7 If you have a thin layer of rice at the top of your pot that does not get cooked all the way through, while the rest of the rice does, then your lid is not tight enough. Use aluminium foil between the pot and the lid next time around. Meanwhile, salvage your present situation by gently covering the partially cooked rice at the top with some fully cooked rice from the bottom. Add a tablespoon or two of water to the pot, cover tightly, this time using the foil , and cook for another ro minutes over very low heat. 8 When removing cooked rice from the pot, use a large slotted spoon.

South Indian-style light, fluffy rice Dakshini chaaval In South India, rice is generally parboiled in a large, round-bottomed, narrow-necked utensil, with lots of water. When it is almost cooked, a cloth is tied to the mouth of the utensil and all the extra water drained out. (This water is later fed to the cows!) The pot is tilted so it lies on its belly over very low heat. A few live coals are placed on top of it as well to dry out the rice grains. Here is how the same rice may be made in a modern kitchen: Serves 6: Long-grain rice measured to the IS £I oz (425ml) level in a glass measuring jug 5 pints (3 litres) water 1 tablespoon salt, optional x-2 oz (zs-sog) unsalted butter, optional Plain basmati rice Basmati chaaval Preheat oven to gas mark 2, 300°F (150°C). Wash the rice in several changes of water and leave it to drain. Fill a large pot with about 5 pints (3 litres) of water. Add the salt to it if you wish and bring to a rolling boil. Empty the rice into the boiling water in a steady stream, stirring as you do so. Let the water come to a boil again. Boil rapidly for 7 minutes. Drain the rice in a colander. Quickly put the rice in an oven- proof pot. Lay the butter over it, cover tightly and put the pot in the oven for 35 minutes or until rice is done. Mix gently before serving.

You may also do so if you wish. Just use 1 teaspoon yellow liquid food colouring diluted with 1 teaspoon water instead of the saffron and warm milk.

They are partially prepared. A seasoned dough made from dried pulses has already been rolled out into the required shapes and then dried in the sun. All that you have to do is cook the poppadum. The cooking process is quick and easy. There are two basic methods to choose from. Deep-frying is the traditional method. This allows the poppadums to expand to their fullest and turn very airy. It also brings out their full flavour. This method does, however, leave those who are nibbling the poppadum with slightly greasy fingers. The second method is to roast the poppadums directly over or under a flame. This way you end up with clean fingers and poppadums with fewer calories. But the poppadums do not expand as much and remain denser than fried ones. Poppadums may be served with drinks or with Indian meals of any sort. Serves 6: The frying method: 6 poppadums Vegetable oil for deep- frying The roasting method: 6 poppadum Depending upon the size of the poppadum, either leave them whole or snap each into two halves. Remember that they will expand in the frying pan. Put about f inch (zcm) of oil in a frying pan and set it to heat over a medium flame. When hot, put in a poppadum (or half a poppadum, depending upon the size of the frying pan and poppadum). It will sizzle and expand within seconds. Remove the pop- padum with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. Cook all poppadum this way. Poppadums should retain their yellowish colour and not turn brown. They should also cook very fast. Adjust your heat, if necessary. Heat your grill. Put I poppadum on a rack and place it about 2- 3 inches (5- 7·5cm) under the grill. Now watch it very carefully. It will expand in seconds.

M y mother once informed me that my passion dates back to the hour of my birth when my grandmother wrote the sacred syllable 'Om' ('I am') on my tongue with a finger dipped in fresh honey. I was apparently observed smacking my lips rather loudly. Starting from that time, food - good food - just appeared miraculously from somewhere at the back of our house in Delhi. It would be preceded by the most tantalizing odours - steaming basmati rice, roasting cumin seeds, cinnamon sticks in hot oil - and the sounds of crockery and cutlery on the move. A bearer, turbaned, sashed, and barefooted would announce the meal and soon we would all be sitting around the dinner table, a family of six, engrossed in eating monsoon mushrooms cooked with coriander and turmeric, rahu fish that my brothers had just caught in the Jam una River, and cubes of lamb smothered in a yoghurt sauce. It was at this stage of innocence that I left India for London, to become a student at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. M y 'digs' were in Brent and consisted of a pleasant room and through the kindness of my landlords, use of the kitchen. 'Use of the kitchen' was all very well, but exactly honJ was I going to use it? M y visits to our kitchen in Delhi had been brief and intermittent. I could not cook. What was worse, I felt clumsy and ignorant. An S 0 S to my mother brought in return a series of reassuring letters, all filled with recipes of my favourite foods. There they were, Kheema malar (Minced meat with peas), Rogan j osh (Red lamb stew), Phoo! gobi aur aloo ki bhaji (Cauliflower with potatoes) ... Slowly, aided by the correspondence course with my encouraging mother, I did learn to cook, eventuall y getting cocky enough to invite large groups of friends over for meals of Shahi karma or Shahjahani murghi (Mughlai chicken with almonds and raisins). Once certain basic principles had been mastered, cooking Indian food had become perfectly accessible. There is something so very satisfying about Indian cookery, more so when it is fresh and home-cooked. Perhaps it is that unique blending of herbs, spices, seasonings, as well as meat, pulses, vegetables, yoghurt dishes and relishes that my ancestors determined centuries ago would titillate 7 our palates. At the same time it preserves our health and the proper chemical balance of our bodies. This combination of wholesome food and endless flavours and dishes makes Indian cookery one of the greatest in the world. Indian food is far more varied than the menus of Indian restaurants suggest. One of my fondest memories of school in Delhi is of the lunches that we all brought from our homes, ensconced in multi-tiered tiffin-carriers. M y stainless steel tiffin-carrier used to dangle from the handle of my bicycle as I rode at great speed to school every morning, my ribboned pigtails fluttering behind me. The smells emanating from it sustained me as I dodged exhaust- spewing buses and later, as I struggled with mind-numbing algebra. When the lunch bell finally set us free, my friends and I would assemble under a shady neem tree if it was summer or on a sunny verandah if it was winter. M y mouth would begin to water even before we opened up our tiffin-carriers. It so happened that all my friends were of differing faiths and all came, originally, from different regions of the country. Even though we were all Indian, we had hardly any culinary traditions in common. Eating always filled us with a sense of adventure and discovery as we could not always anticipate what the others might bring. My Punjabi friend was of the Sikh faith . She often brought large, round parathas made with wheat and ghee produced on her fami ly farm. These parathas were sometimes stuffed with tart pomegranate seeds and sometimes with cauliflower. We ate them with a sweet-and-sour, homemade turnip pickle. Another friend was a Muslim from Uttar Pradesh, known to bring beef cooked with spinach, all deliciously flavoured with chillies, cardamom and cloves. Many of us were Hindus and not supposed to eat beef. So we just pretended not to know what it was. Our fingers would work busily around the tender meat that covered the bones and our cheeks would hollow as we sucked up the spicy marrow from the marrow bones. But we never asked what we were eating. The food was far too good for that. On the other hand, whenever my father went boar-hunting and we cooked that meat at home, I never took it to school. I knew it would offend my Muslim friends. Another member of our gang was a Jain from Gujerat. Jains are vegetarians, some of them so orthodox as to refrain from eating beetroots and tomatoes because their colour reminds them of blood, and root vegetables because in pulling them out of the earth some innocent insect might have to lose its life. This friend occasionally brought the most delicious pancakes - pooras - made out oflegumes. One of us came from Kashmir, India's northernmost state. As she thrilled us with tales about tobogganing - the rest of us had never seen snow - she would unpack morel mushrooms from Kashmiri forests, cooked with tomatoes and peas and flaYoured with asafetida. She was a Hindu, of course. Only Kashmiri Hindus cook with asafetida. And they do not cook with garlic. 8 INTRODUCTION Kashmiri M uslims cook with garlic and frown upon asafetida. I found all this much easier to follow than algebra. We had a South Indian friend too, a Syrian Christian from K erala. She often brought idfis, slightly sour, steamed rice cakes that we ate with sambar, a pulse and fresh vegetable stew. I, a D elhi Hindu, tried to dazzle my fri ends with quail and partridge which my father shot regularly and which our cook prepared with onions, ginger, cinnamon, black pepper, and yoghurt. India is such a large country - over a million square miles of changing topography, di vided into thirty-one states and territories. Geography and local produce have played a great part in forming regional culinary tradi tions. Religious groups within each state ha ve modified these regional cuisines even further to suit their own restrictions. History too, has had its influences. Goa, for example, on India's west coast, was ruled by the Portuguese for four centuries. Many of its people were converted to Catholicism, some by Saint F rancis Xavier himself, and eventuall y developed an eating style which included platters of Beef Roulade - a stuffed roll of beef cooked in garlic- flavoured oli ve oil. and a dessert of layered pancakes - Bibingka - made with egg yolks, coconut milk, and raw Indian sugar. British colonialists left quite a few dishes in their wake too. There were those cutfis (cutlets) that our cook made. H e, of course, marinaded them in ginger and garlic first. T hen, there was the strong influence of the Moghuls. T hey had come to India via Persia in the sixteenth century and introduced the sub-continent to delicate Pullaos and meats cooked with yoghurt and fried onions. If there is a common denominator in all Indian foods, it is, perhaps, the imaginati ve use of spices. D oes this mean that Indian food is always spicy? Well, in a sense it does. It ahvays uses spices, sometimes just one spice to cook a potato dish and sometimes up to fi fteen spices to make an elaborate meat dish. But it is not always hot. The 'heat' in Indian food comes from hot chillies. Chilli peppers were introduced to Asia in the sixteenth century by the Portuguese who had discovered them in the New W orld. Our own pungent spices until that time were the more moderate mustard seeds and black peppercorns. Those of you who do not like hot food should just leave out all the chillies - red, green, or cayenne - in my recipes. Your food will still be authenticall y Indian, superb in flavour and not at all hot. The spices and seasonings that we do like to use in our food include cumin, coriander, turmeric, black pepper, mustard seeds, fennel seeds, cinnamon, cardamom, and cloves. Sometimes we leave the spices whole and fry them, sometimes we roast the spices and at other times we grind them and mix them with water or vinegar to make a paste. Each of these techniques draws out a completely different flavour from the same spice. T his way we can give a great variety to, say, a vegetable like a potato, not only by methods such as boiling, baking and roasting but by cooking it with whole cumin one time, a INTRODUCTION 9 combination of ground cumin and roasted fennel another time, and black pepper a third time. The permutations become endless as does the possibility of variety in tastes. D oes this mean that you cannot cook Indian food without having a whole lot of spices? I suggest that you start off with buying the specific spices you need to cook a selected dish and then slowly increase your spice 'wardrobe'. It is a bit like being a painter, I suppose. If you have a palette glowing with magenta and cobalt blue and sap green and vermilion, it will give you the confidence - and the choice - to do anything you want. You could use one colour, if you desired, or ten. It is the same with spices. It is nice to knm.v that they are there. Whole spices last a long time. T his way, you can cook aubergines with fennel seeds one day and green beans with cumin seeds the next day, if that is what you want. Once you have mastered the use of Indian spices, you will find yourself not only cooking Indian meals but also inventing dishes with an Indian flavour and using Indian spices in unexpected ways. A F rench chef who once observed me cooking, now regularly uses ground roasted cumin seeds in his cream of tomato soup. I myself have created an Indian-style dish of pork chipolatas for this book to start you off in this pleasant direction. (See page 61.) Since it is the carefull y orchestrated use of spices, seasonings and flavourings that gives Indian food its unique character, it might be useful to examine them singly and remove their mystery. I 0 INTRODUCTION SPICES, SEASONINGS AND FLAVOURINGS I I M any of the spices used in Indian foods can be now found in supermarkets. These include cumin, coriander, turmeric, cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, nutmeg, black pepper, bay leaves, ginger, paprika, and cayenne pepper. Others have to be searched out from delicatessens and Greek, Indian or Pakistani grocers. Such grocers can now be found in all major cities and in many small towns as well. It is also possible to order spices by post. Ideally speaking, it is best to buy all dry spices in their whole form . They will stay fresh for long periods if stored in cool, dry, dark places in tightly lidded jars. T his way you can grind the spices as you need them. I use an electric coffee-grinder for this purpose although a pestle and mortar would do. T he more freshly ground the spices, the better their flavour. If you can only buy ground spices, buy small quantities and store them, too, in cool, dry, dark places in tightly lidded jars. When transferring spices from plastic packets to jars, be sure to label them. When buying spices from ethnic grocers, make sure that they are labelled. M any of my cooking students have come to me with unlabelled jars and asked, 'What do I have here?' Even I, who have been cooking now for twenty-five years, cannot tell the difference between ground cumin and ground coriander without tasting or smelling them first. H ere is a list of the spices, seasonings, and flavourings I have used in this book: I 2 SPI CES, SEASON! G A D FLAVOURI NGS Asafetida He eng Cardamom, pods and seeds Elaichi The Indian source for this smelly resin has traditionally been Afghanistan and Western Kashmir. In its lump form, asafetida looks rather like the brown rosin my husband uses on the bow of his violin. Its smell is another matter. James Beard, America's foremost food writer, once compared the smell to that of fresh truffles. This seasoning is a digestive and is used in very small quantities. (It can even cure horses of indigestion!) A pinch of it is thrown into very hot oil and allowed to fry for a second before other foods are added. As asafetida can only be found at Indian and Pakistani grocers, I have made its use optional in my recipes. If you wish to purchase it, I suggest that you buy the smallest box available of ground asafetida. Make sure that the lid sits tightly on the box when you store it. Cardamom pods are whitish or green and have parchment like skins and lots of round, black, highly aromatic seeds inside. The whitish pods are more easily available in supermar- kets. They have been bleached and have less flavour and aroma than the unbleached green ones. For my recipes, use whichever pods you can find easily, although the green ones are better. Many of my recipes call f0r whole pods. They are used as a flavouring in both savoury and sweet dishes. When used whole, cardamom pods are not meant to be eaten. We leave them on the side of the plate, along with any bones. When a recipe calls for cardamom seeds, you can either take the seeds out of the pods (a somewhat tedious task, best done while watching television) or else you can buy the seeds from the few Indian and Pakistani grocers who sell them. If my recipe calls for a small amount of ground cardamom seed, just pulverise the seeds in a mortar. SPICES, SEASO lNG AND FLAVOURINGS IJ Cayenne pepper Pisi hui lal mirch Chillies, fresh, hot, green Hari mirch Chillies, whole, dried, hot, red Sabut lal mirch Made from dried red chillies, this is called red chilli powder by Indian and Pakistani grocers. Most of my recipes have a flexible amount of cayenne pepper in them. It is hard to know how hot people like their food. Use the smaller amount if you want your foods just mildly hot and the larger amount if you want it hotter. Cayenne pepper is sold in all supermarkets. These fresh chillies, 2- 4 inches (s- rocm) long, green outside and filled with flat, round, white seeds, are sold by Asian grocers, some supermarkets and increasingly in street mar- kets. Besides being rich in Vitamins A and C, they give Indian foods a very special fla vour. If my recipe calls for them, make at least one good effort to find them. If you are unsuccess- ful, use a little more cayenne pepper as a substitute. Green chillies should be stored unwashed and wrapped in newspaper, in a plastic container in the refrigerator. Any chillies that go bad should be thrown away as they affect the whole batch. IMPORTA T: Be careful when handling cut green chillies. Refrain from touching your eyes or your mouth; wash your hands as soon as possible, otherwise you will 'burn' your skin with the irritant the chillies contain. If you want the green chilli flavour without most of the heat, remove the white seeds. T hese chillies, about rt- 2 inches (4- scm) long and t - t inch (approx rem) wide, are often thrown into hot oil for a few seconds until they puff up and their skin darkens. This fried skin adds its own very special flavour to a host of meats, vegetables, and pulses. Handle these chillies carefull y, making sure that you 14 SPI CES, SEASON ING AND FLAVOUR! GS Cinnamon Dar cheeni Cl0ves, whole Long Coconut, fresh grated Nariyal wash your hands well before you touch your face. If you want the flavour of the chillies without their heat, make a small opening in them and then shake out and discard their seeds. These chillies are sold by most Asian grocers and in many supermarkets. Buy sticks. We often use them whole in meat and rice dishes. The sticks are used just for their flavour and aroma and are not meant to be eaten. They can be found in all supermarkets. We often use whole cloves in our meat and rice dishes for their flavour and aroma. They are not meant to be eaten. (It must be added that we do suck on cloves as a mouth freshener.) Whole cloves are sold by most supermarkets. When buying coconuts, make sure that they are crack-free and have no mould on them. Shake them to make sure that they are heavy with liquid. Now hold a coconut in one hand over a sink and hit it around the centre with the claw end of a hammer or with the blunt side of a heavy cleaver. The coconut should crack and break into two halves. (You could, if you like, collect the liquid in a cup. It is not used in cooking, but you may drink it. I do. I consider it my revvard for breaking open the coconut in the first place.) Taste a piece of the coconut to make sure it is sweet and not rancid . Prise off the coconut flesh from the hard shell with a knife. If it proves to be too obstinate, it helps to put the coconut halves, cut side up, directly over a low flame, turning them around now and then so they char slightly. The woody shell contracts and releases the kernel. SPICES, SEASONING AND FLAVOUR! GS I 5 Coriander, fresh green Hara dhaniya or Kothmir Now peel off the brown coconut skin with a potato peeler and break the flesh into r inch (z.scm) pieces (larger ones if you are grating manually). Wash off these coconut pieces and either grate them finel y on a hand grater or else put them in an electric blender or food processor. Do not worry about turning them into pulp in these electric machines. What you will end up with will be very finely 'grated' coconut, perfect for all the Indian dishes that require it. Grated coconut freezes beautifully and defrosts fast. I always grate large quantities whenever I have the time and store it in the freezer for future use. Fresh coconuts are sold by all Asian grocers and are widely available in ordinary greengrocers' shops. This is one of India's favourite herbs and is used, just as parsley might be, both as a garnish and for its flavour. This pretty green plant grows about 6- 8 inches (r s- zocm) in height. Just the top, leafy section is used, though the stems are sometimes thrown into pulse dishes for their aroma. This herb is worth hunting for as its delicate flavour is unique. It is sold by Asian grocers, but it may also be grown at home from coriander seeds. To store fresh green coriander, put it in its unwashed state, roots and all, into a container filled with water, almost as if you were putting flowers in a vase. The leafy section of the plant should not be in water. Pull a polythene bag over the coriander and container and re- frigerate the whole thing. The fresh coriander should last for weeks. Every other day, pick off and discard the yellowing leaves. If you cannot find fresh coriander, use parsley as a substitute. r6 SPICES, SEASONING AND FLAVOURINGS Coriander seeds, whole and ground Dhania, sabut and pzsa Cumin seeds, whole and ground Zeera, sabut and pzsa Roasted cumin seeds Ground roasted cumin seeds These are the round, beige seeds of the coriander plant.

I like to put my home-ground coriander seeds through a sieve though this is not essential.

It is light, cooks fast, and may be prepared simpl y and elegantl y at the same time. Needless to say, the types of fish available in Indian riYers, lakes, and seas arc different from the ones found in th e colder British \\\\·aters. What used to be one of the common seafood s, fresh uncooked prawns, seems to have disappeared entirely from markets in Britain. I am hard put to understand why, since they can be found al l over France, just a few miles a'vvay. What I ha\\·e done for this chapter is to work out Indian-style recipes for the fish that are commonly available in Britain. The prawns I ha\\·e used are the cooked, packed frozen ones that arc found in supermarkets, or freezer centres and fishmongers. Just look for the largest and best varieties that you can find . Indians eat a fair amount of breaded, fried fish. I have used plaice for this as it is similar to our pomfret, at least in general shape. Our mackerel has a plumper form but is very similar in taste. So I have used it for a west coast recipe that calls for a fresh coriander and lemon marinade. We have no cod, halibut or haddock in India but the textures of some of our ri ver fi sh are similar. I have used them in Indian-style recipes in which they arc cooked with tomatoes or yoghurt or ca uliflower. I have even included a recipe for mussels. This is a Goan recipe, one of the few in this book that uses fresh cocon ut. It is an exquisite dish that can be made either with cockles or mussels. I need hardly repeat that if you are buying fresh fish, make sure that it is fresh. T he gi lls should be bright red, the eyes clear, the skin shiny, and the body firm and ta ut.

As many Indians are vegetarians, we have, over the years, worked out a great variety of ways to cook our everyday vegetables such as cabbages, green beans, beetroots and carrots. Sometimes the vegetables are cut into shreds or slices and quickly stir-fried with whole spices such as cumin and mustard seeds. These are referred to as 'dry' vegetables and rarely have even the glimmer of a sauce. At other times we may cook root vegetables in a thick ginger-garlic sauce or with tomatoes. Such dishes are referred to as 'wet' dishes because of the sauce. They are generally served in small, individual bowls. Both 'dry' and 'wet' dishes may be served with rice or Indian breads. For those of you who are vegetarians - or want to cut down on your meat intake - you can make perfectly balanced meals by picking two or three vegetables from this chapter and then adding a pulse dish, a rice or bread and a yoghurt relish. 98 VEGETABLES", "labels": ["Irrelevant"]}, "id": "Yo-DRknEua", "from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels"}, {"value": {"start": 155753, "end": 157155, "text": "Fried aubergine slices Tala hua baigan This is one of the simplest ways of cooking aubergines in India.

But beans, by themselves, are an incomplete food and need to be complemented - at the same meal - with a grain (rice or bread) and a dairy product (such as yoghurt or cheese). When nutritionists tell us today that this food combination has as much protein as a steak, I cannot help but think of the villagers in India whose basic diet, for centuries, has been dais (split peas) and rice or bread, washed down with a glass of buttermilk. Perhaps these villagers are not so badly off, after all! Apart from their food value, I find beans very versatile. Their non- asserti ve tastes and textures allow them to be used easily in soups. They also combine beautifully with meats and vegetables to make excellent main courses. Sometimes pulses can be hard to digest. The same Indian forbears who worked out that a nutritionally balanced vegetarian meal contained pulses, grains, and dairy products, also knew - I do not know how - that certain seasonings made beans more digestible. Today pulses in India are almost always cooked with at least one of the following: ginger, asafetida, and turmeric. We have man y different types of pulses in India. Some are left whole, others are split and sometimes skinned. It is the split peas that are called dais. The splitting helps to cook them much faster. All pulses need to be picked over and washed as the packets often include small stones and husks. Whole beans should either be soaked in water overnight before they are cooked or else they can be boiled in water for 2 minutes and then left to soak in the boiling water for an hour. The cooking time for all pulses varies according to their freshness. The fresher they are, the faster they cook. When cooking split peas, Indians always leave the lid slightly ajar. The reason for this is that split peas create a lot of thick froth as they cook and this blocks up the normal escape routes for the steam. So the pot boils over, creating a mess on the cooker. Leaving the lid slightly ajar helps to avoid this. All beans should be stored in tightly lidded containers. H ere is a description of the pulses I have used in this book: I20 PULSES Red split lentils Masoor dal Whole green lentils Moong dal Chana dal Black-eyed beans Lobhia Chickpeas Chhole These salmon-coloured, round, split lentils are available widely in most supermarkets. They turn pale yellow during cooking and have a pleasant, mild fla vour. These round, flying-saucer-shaped, greenish- brown lentils are very similar to our unsplit, unskinned masoor. They are available in all supermarkets and have the virtue of cooking quite fast. This is the skinned and split version of the same mung bean that is used to make bean sprouts for oriental cooking. The grains are pale yellow and somewhat elongated. This is, perhaps, the most popular North Indian da f. It has a mild, aristocratic flavour and is sold by Indian, Pakistani and Greek grocers, and increasingly by many supermarkets. This is very similar to the yellow split peas that are sold in supermarkets, only the grains are smaller and the flavour 'meatier' and sweeter. Chana dal is sold mainly by Indian and Pakistani grocers. Yellow split peas may be substituted for chana dal in my recipes. These excellent beans, greyish or beige ovals, graced with a dark dot, are sold widely in all supermarkets. They have a slightly smokey flavour. This large, heart-shaped, beige-coloured pea is sold by most supermarkets as well as South Asian, and Middle Eastern grocers. It lends itself to being cooked as a spicy snack food as well as being combined with meats and vegetables.

Many of these everyday breads are made with a very finely ground wholewheat flour that we call ala. I find that the British flour that approximates ala best is wheatmeal flour because it has just enough bran in it to give it body without making it too coarse for our soft, pliable breads. Of course, if you have access to Indian grocers and can buy ala (sometimes called chapati flour) do, by all means, use it. Some of our breads, such as the poori, are deep-fried. The ideal utensil for this is the Indian karhai because it is very economical on oil and because it prevents hot oil from splashing on to the cooker. A deep frying pan may be used as a substitute. Many other breads are cooked on a lava, a concave cast iron plate that is heated before breads such as chapatis and paralhas are slapped on to it. As I have suggested in the chapter on equipment, a cast-iron frying pan makes a perfectly adequate substitute. You will find one other kind ofbread in this chapter.

Moong dal pancakes with peas Gujerati poore Savoury pancakes made out of split peas, or rice and split peas, provide much of India with a nourishing snack food. These protein-rich pancakes are also eaten by many vegetarian Indians at breakfast, usually accompanied by a chutney and a glass of fresh buttermilk. You could also serve them with tea. Makes about 9: 6! oz (I9og) moong dal, picked over, washed, and drained 2 oz (sog) shelled peas A 1 inch (2.5cm) cube of ginger, peeled and coarsely chopped 2-3 cloves garlic, peeled 1-2 fresh, hot green chillies, cut into 4 pieces each 1 teaspoon salt i teaspoon ground turmeric 3 fl oz (7sml) plus 1 tablespoon water 2 oz (sog) onion, peeled and minced 2 tablespoons finely chopped coriander ± teaspoon baking soda About 4 fl oz (12sml) vegetable oil Put the dal in a bowl.

Combine the ginger, garlic, chillies, salt, turmeric, da/, and 3 f1 OZ ( 7 5ml) plus 1 tablespoon water in the container of an electric blender. Blend until you have a smooth batter. Let the machine run for 2- 3 minutes more so the batter gets light and airy. Empty the batter into a bowl. Add the onion and fresh coriander and peas. Mix. The batter may now be covered and refrigerated, if you like, for up to 24 hours. Just before you get ready to cook, add the baking soda and mix it in . Remember to stir the batter before you make each pancake. Brush an 8 inch (2ocm) non-stick frying pan with about 1 teaspoon of oil and set it to heat over a medium-low flame.

The method you choose depends upon the recipe and what you want the rice to do. If you are unsure about cooking rice, just follow my recipes carefully and you should not go wrong. There are a few things that are worth remembering when cooking rice: 1 Use a heavy pot with a very tight-fitting lid. If you have a tin-lined copper pot hanging decoratively in your kitchen, this is your chance to use it. An enamelled, cast-iron pot is also good for rice. I find that such pots generally have fairly loose-fitting lids. There is a very quick remedy for this. Just cover the pot tightly with a sheet of aluminium foil first and then with its own lid. You can also make good rice in heavy, stainless steel pots. Any time you are unsure about the fittin g of the lid, interpose a layer of aluminium foil between it and the pot. Be sure to crinkle the edges of the foil so that hardly any steam escapes. In many of my recipes, the rice ends up by cooking in steam. If too much of it escapes, the rice will not cook properly. 2 For best results, rice should be washed in several changes of water and then soaked for about 30 minutes before it is cooked. The washing gets rid of the starchy powder left over from the milling process. The soaking lets each grain absorb water so it sticks less to the next grain while it is cooking. 3 If you are cooking rice with just enough water or stock needed for absorption,", "labels": ["Recipe_Steps"]}, "id": "dIvW_xi8uv", "from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels"}, {"value": {"start": 229911, "end": 230066, "text": "5 Once I cover my rice pot with a lid, I like to cook it on a very, very low flame.

Precious steam will escape and the rice will cook unevenly. 7 If you have a thin layer of rice at the top of your pot that does not get cooked all the way through, while the rest of the rice does, then your lid is not tight enough. Use aluminium foil between the pot and the lid next time around.

Basmati rice grows best in the foothills of the Himalaya Mountains, in both India and Pakistan. Actually, it too is a long grain rice, only the grains are slender, delicate, naturally perfumed, and somewhat more expensive! The best basmati rice is aged for a year before it is sold. This ageing increases its unusual, nutty aroma. While it is not necessary to pick over and wash packaged American rice (though washing will give it a better texture) basmati rice must be picked over, washed and soaked before cooking as it often contains small stones and other impurities. To pick it over, empty the rice onto one end of a large platter. Now work the rice from one side of the platter to the other, inspecting the grains carefully. Push any stones or other suspicious objects to one side. Washing the grains: put the picked rice in your largest bowl. ow fill the bowl with cold water and gently swirl the rice around in it. The water will become cloudy with starch. Carefully pour the water away, holding back the rice with your free hand . Repeat 5 or 6 times, or as long as it takes for the water to remain reasonably clear. Soaking: Fill up the bowl again, only this time leave the rice in the water for 20 minutes to half an hour. Now drain the rice in a sieve. It should sit in the sieve for at least 20 minutes to become fairly dry before you cook it. If you use this method of preparation, combined with any of the various cooking methods given in the recipes, you will find that you need dramatically less water than you may have come to expect.

M y mother once informed me that my passion dates back to the hour of my birth when my grandmother wrote the sacred syllable 'Om' ('I am') on my tongue with a finger dipped in fresh honey. I was apparently observed smacking my lips rather loudly. Starting from that time, food - good food - just appeared miraculously from somewhere at the back of our house in Delhi. It would be preceded by the most tantalizing odours - steaming basmati rice, roasting cumin seeds, cinnamon sticks in hot oil - and the sounds of crockery and cutlery on the move. A bearer, turbaned, sashed, and barefooted would announce the meal and soon we would all be sitting around the dinner table, a family of six, engrossed in eating monsoon mushrooms cooked with coriander and turmeric, rahu fish that my brothers had just caught in the Jam una River, and cubes of lamb smothered in a yoghurt sauce. It was at this stage of innocence that I left India for London, to become a student at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art. M y 'digs' were in Brent and consisted of a pleasant room and through the kindness of my landlords, use of the kitchen. 'Use of the kitchen' was all very well, but exactly honJ was I going to use it? M y visits to our kitchen in Delhi had been brief and intermittent. I could not cook. What was worse, I felt clumsy and ignorant. An S 0 S to my mother brought in return a series of reassuring letters, all filled with recipes of my favourite foods. There they were, Kheema malar (Minced meat with peas), Rogan j osh (Red lamb stew), Phoo! gobi aur aloo ki bhaji (Cauliflower with potatoes) ... Slowly, aided by the correspondence course with my encouraging mother, I did learn to cook, eventuall y getting cocky enough to invite large groups of friends over for meals of Shahi karma or Shahjahani murghi (Mughlai chicken with almonds and raisins). Once certain basic principles had been mastered, cooking Indian food had become perfectly accessible. There is something so very satisfying about Indian cookery, more so when it is fresh and home-cooked. Perhaps it is that unique blending of herbs, spices, seasonings, as well as meat, pulses, vegetables, yoghurt dishes and relishes that my ancestors determined centuries ago would titillate 7 our palates. At the same time it preserves our health and the proper chemical balance of our bodies. This combination of wholesome food and endless flavours and dishes makes Indian cookery one of the greatest in the world. Indian food is far more varied than the menus of Indian restaurants suggest. One of my fondest memories of school in Delhi is of the lunches that we all brought from our homes, ensconced in multi-tiered tiffin-carriers. M y stainless steel tiffin-carrier used to dangle from the handle of my bicycle as I rode at great speed to school every morning, my ribboned pigtails fluttering behind me. The smells emanating from it sustained me as I dodged exhaust- spewing buses and later, as I struggled with mind-numbing algebra. When the lunch bell finally set us free, my friends and I would assemble under a shady neem tree if it was summer or on a sunny verandah if it was winter. M y mouth would begin to water even before we opened up our tiffin-carriers. It so happened that all my friends were of differing faiths and all came, originally, from different regions of the country. Even though we were all Indian, we had hardly any culinary traditions in common. Eating always filled us with a sense of adventure and discovery as we could not always anticipate what the others might bring. My Punjabi friend was of the Sikh faith . She often brought large, round parathas made with wheat and ghee produced on her fami ly farm. These parathas were sometimes stuffed with tart pomegranate seeds and sometimes with cauliflower. We ate them with a sweet-and-sour, homemade turnip pickle. Another friend was a Muslim from Uttar Pradesh, known to bring beef cooked with spinach, all deliciously flavoured with chillies, cardamom and cloves. Many of us were Hindus and not supposed to eat beef. So we just pretended not to know what it was. Our fingers would work busily around the tender meat that covered the bones and our cheeks would hollow as we sucked up the spicy marrow from the marrow bones. But we never asked what we were eating. The food was far too good for that. On the other hand, whenever my father went boar-hunting and we cooked that meat at home, I never took it to school. I knew it would offend my Muslim friends. Another member of our gang was a Jain from Gujerat. Jains are vegetarians, some of them so orthodox as to refrain from eating beetroots and tomatoes because their colour reminds them of blood, and root vegetables because in pulling them out of the earth some innocent insect might have to lose its life. This friend occasionally brought the most delicious pancakes - pooras - made out oflegumes. One of us came from Kashmir, India's northernmost state. As she thrilled us with tales about tobogganing - the rest of us had never seen snow - she would unpack morel mushrooms from Kashmiri forests, cooked with tomatoes and peas and flaYoured with asafetida. She was a Hindu, of course. Only Kashmiri Hindus cook with asafetida. And they do not cook with garlic. 8 INTRODUCTION Kashmiri M uslims cook with garlic and frown upon asafetida. I found all this much easier to follow than algebra. We had a South Indian friend too, a Syrian Christian from K erala. She often brought idfis, slightly sour, steamed rice cakes that we ate with sambar, a pulse and fresh vegetable stew. I, a D elhi Hindu, tried to dazzle my fri ends with quail and partridge which my father shot regularly and which our cook prepared with onions, ginger, cinnamon, black pepper, and yoghurt. India is such a large country - over a million square miles of changing topography, di vided into thirty-one states and territories. Geography and local produce have played a great part in forming regional culinary tradi tions. Religious groups within each state ha ve modified these regional cuisines even further to suit their own restrictions. History too, has had its influences. Goa, for example, on India's west coast, was ruled by the Portuguese for four centuries. Many of its people were converted to Catholicism, some by Saint F rancis Xavier himself, and eventuall y developed an eating style which included platters of Beef Roulade - a stuffed roll of beef cooked in garlic- flavoured oli ve oil. and a dessert of layered pancakes - Bibingka - made with egg yolks, coconut milk, and raw Indian sugar. British colonialists left quite a few dishes in their wake too. There were those cutfis (cutlets) that our cook made. H e, of course, marinaded them in ginger and garlic first. T hen, there was the strong influence of the Moghuls. T hey had come to India via Persia in the sixteenth century and introduced the sub-continent to delicate Pullaos and meats cooked with yoghurt and fried onions. If there is a common denominator in all Indian foods, it is, perhaps, the imaginati ve use of spices. D oes this mean that Indian food is always spicy? Well, in a sense it does. It ahvays uses spices, sometimes just one spice to cook a potato dish and sometimes up to fi fteen spices to make an elaborate meat dish. But it is not always hot. The 'heat' in Indian food comes from hot chillies. Chilli peppers were introduced to Asia in the sixteenth century by the Portuguese who had discovered them in the New W orld. Our own pungent spices until that time were the more moderate mustard seeds and black peppercorns. Those of you who do not like hot food should just leave out all the chillies - red, green, or cayenne - in my recipes. Your food will still be authenticall y Indian, superb in flavour and not at all hot. The spices and seasonings that we do like to use in our food include cumin, coriander, turmeric, black pepper, mustard seeds, fennel seeds, cinnamon, cardamom, and cloves. Sometimes we leave the spices whole and fry them, sometimes we roast the spices and at other times we grind them and mix them with water or vinegar to make a paste. Each of these techniques draws out a completely different flavour from the same spice. T his way we can give a great variety to, say, a vegetable like a potato, not only by methods such as boiling, baking and roasting but by cooking it with whole cumin one time, a INTRODUCTION 9 combination of ground cumin and roasted fennel another time, and black pepper a third time. The permutations become endless as does the possibility of variety in tastes. D oes this mean that you cannot cook Indian food without having a whole lot of spices? I suggest that you start off with buying the specific spices you need to cook a selected dish and then slowly increase your spice 'wardrobe'. It is a bit like being a painter, I suppose. If you have a palette glowing with magenta and cobalt blue and sap green and vermilion, it will give you the confidence - and the choice - to do anything you want. You could use one colour, if you desired, or ten. It is the same with spices. It is nice to knm.v that they are there. Whole spices last a long time. T his way, you can cook aubergines with fennel seeds one day and green beans with cumin seeds the next day, if that is what you want. Once you have mastered the use of Indian spices, you will find yourself not only cooking Indian meals but also inventing dishes with an Indian flavour and using Indian spices in unexpected ways. A F rench chef who once observed me cooking, now regularly uses ground roasted cumin seeds in his cream of tomato soup. I myself have created an Indian-style dish of pork chipolatas for this book to start you off in this pleasant direction. (See page 61.) Since it is the carefull y orchestrated use of spices, seasonings and flavourings that gives Indian food its unique character, it might be useful to examine them singly and remove their mystery. I 0 INTRODUCTION SPICES, SEASONINGS AND FLAVOURINGS I I M any of the spices used in Indian foods can be now found in supermarkets. These include cumin, coriander, turmeric, cloves, cinnamon, cardamom, nutmeg, black pepper, bay leaves, ginger, paprika, and cayenne pepper. Others have to be searched out from delicatessens and Greek, Indian or Pakistani grocers. Such grocers can now be found in all major cities and in many small towns as well. It is also possible to order spices by post. Ideally speaking, it is best to buy all dry spices in their whole form . They will stay fresh for long periods if stored in cool, dry, dark places in tightly lidded jars. T his way you can grind the spices as you need them. I use an electric coffee-grinder for this purpose although a pestle and mortar would do. T he more freshly ground the spices, the better their flavour. If you can only buy ground spices, buy small quantities and store them, too, in cool, dry, dark places in tightly lidded jars. When transferring spices from plastic packets to jars, be sure to label them. When buying spices from ethnic grocers, make sure that they are labelled. M any of my cooking students have come to me with unlabelled jars and asked, 'What do I have here?' Even I, who have been cooking now for twenty-five years, cannot tell the difference between ground cumin and ground coriander without tasting or smelling them first. H ere is a list of the spices, seasonings, and flavourings I have used in this book: I 2 SPI CES, SEASON! G A D FLAVOURI NGS Asafetida He eng Cardamom, pods and seeds Elaichi The Indian source for this smelly resin has traditionally been Afghanistan and Western Kashmir. In its lump form, asafetida looks rather like the brown rosin my husband uses on the bow of his violin. Its smell is another matter. James Beard, America's foremost food writer, once compared the smell to that of fresh truffles. This seasoning is a digestive and is used in very small quantities. (It can even cure horses of indigestion!) A pinch of it is thrown into very hot oil and allowed to fry for a second before other foods are added. As asafetida can only be found at Indian and Pakistani grocers, I have made its use optional in my recipes. If you wish to purchase it, I suggest that you buy the smallest box available of ground asafetida. Make sure that the lid sits tightly on the box when you store it. Cardamom pods are whitish or green and have parchment like skins and lots of round, black, highly aromatic seeds inside. The whitish pods are more easily available in supermar- kets. They have been bleached and have less flavour and aroma than the unbleached green ones. For my recipes, use whichever pods you can find easily, although the green ones are better. Many of my recipes call f0r whole pods. They are used as a flavouring in both savoury and sweet dishes. When used whole, cardamom pods are not meant to be eaten. We leave them on the side of the plate, along with any bones. When a recipe calls for cardamom seeds, you can either take the seeds out of the pods (a somewhat tedious task, best done while watching television) or else you can buy the seeds from the few Indian and Pakistani grocers who sell them. If my recipe calls for a small amount of ground cardamom seed, just pulverise the seeds in a mortar. SPICES, SEASO lNG AND FLAVOURINGS IJ Cayenne pepper Pisi hui lal mirch Chillies, fresh, hot, green Hari mirch Chillies, whole, dried, hot, red Sabut lal mirch Made from dried red chillies, this is called red chilli powder by Indian and Pakistani grocers. Most of my recipes have a flexible amount of cayenne pepper in them. It is hard to know how hot people like their food. Use the smaller amount if you want your foods just mildly hot and the larger amount if you want it hotter. Cayenne pepper is sold in all supermarkets. These fresh chillies, 2- 4 inches (s- rocm) long, green outside and filled with flat, round, white seeds, are sold by Asian grocers, some supermarkets and increasingly in street mar- kets. Besides being rich in Vitamins A and C, they give Indian foods a very special fla vour. If my recipe calls for them, make at least one good effort to find them. If you are unsuccess- ful, use a little more cayenne pepper as a substitute. Green chillies should be stored unwashed and wrapped in newspaper, in a plastic container in the refrigerator. Any chillies that go bad should be thrown away as they affect the whole batch. IMPORTA T: Be careful when handling cut green chillies. Refrain from touching your eyes or your mouth; wash your hands as soon as possible, otherwise you will 'burn' your skin with the irritant the chillies contain. If you want the green chilli flavour without most of the heat, remove the white seeds. T hese chillies, about rt- 2 inches (4- scm) long and t - t inch (approx rem) wide, are often thrown into hot oil for a few seconds until they puff up and their skin darkens. This fried skin adds its own very special flavour to a host of meats, vegetables, and pulses. Handle these chillies carefull y, making sure that you 14 SPI CES, SEASON ING AND FLAVOUR! GS Cinnamon Dar cheeni Cl0ves, whole Long Coconut, fresh grated Nariyal wash your hands well before you touch your face. If you want the flavour of the chillies without their heat, make a small opening in them and then shake out and discard their seeds. These chillies are sold by most Asian grocers and in many supermarkets. Buy sticks. We often use them whole in meat and rice dishes. The sticks are used just for their flavour and aroma and are not meant to be eaten. They can be found in all supermarkets. We often use whole cloves in our meat and rice dishes for their flavour and aroma. They are not meant to be eaten. (It must be added that we do suck on cloves as a mouth freshener.) Whole cloves are sold by most supermarkets. When buying coconuts, make sure that they are crack-free and have no mould on them. Shake them to make sure that they are heavy with liquid. Now hold a coconut in one hand over a sink and hit it around the centre with the claw end of a hammer or with the blunt side of a heavy cleaver. The coconut should crack and break into two halves. (You could, if you like, collect the liquid in a cup. It is not used in cooking, but you may drink it. I do. I consider it my revvard for breaking open the coconut in the first place.) Taste a piece of the coconut to make sure it is sweet and not rancid . Prise off the coconut flesh from the hard shell with a knife. If it proves to be too obstinate, it helps to put the coconut halves, cut side up, directly over a low flame, turning them around now and then so they char slightly. The woody shell contracts and releases the kernel. SPICES, SEASONING AND FLAVOUR! GS I 5 Coriander, fresh green Hara dhaniya or Kothmir Now peel off the brown coconut skin with a potato peeler and break the flesh into r inch (z.scm) pieces (larger ones if you are grating manually). Wash off these coconut pieces and either grate them finel y on a hand grater or else put them in an electric blender or food processor. Do not worry about turning them into pulp in these electric machines. What you will end up with will be very finely 'grated' coconut, perfect for all the Indian dishes that require it. Grated coconut freezes beautifully and defrosts fast. I always grate large quantities whenever I have the time and store it in the freezer for future use. Fresh coconuts are sold by all Asian grocers and are widely available in ordinary greengrocers' shops. This is one of India's favourite herbs and is used, just as parsley might be, both as a garnish and for its flavour. This pretty green plant grows about 6- 8 inches (r s- zocm) in height. Just the top, leafy section is used, though the stems are sometimes thrown into pulse dishes for their aroma. This herb is worth hunting for as its delicate flavour is unique. It is sold by Asian grocers, but it may also be grown at home from coriander seeds. To store fresh green coriander, put it in its unwashed state, roots and all, into a container filled with water, almost as if you were putting flowers in a vase. The leafy section of the plant should not be in water. Pull a polythene bag over the coriander and container and re- frigerate the whole thing. The fresh coriander should last for weeks. Every other day, pick off and discard the yellowing leaves. If you cannot find fresh coriander, use parsley as a substitute. r6 SPICES, SEASONING AND FLAVOURINGS Coriander seeds, whole and ground Dhania, sabut and pzsa Cumin seeds, whole and ground Zeera, sabut and pzsa Roasted cumin seeds Ground roasted cumin seeds These are the round, beige seeds of the coriander plant. They are used a lot in Indian cooking, generally in their ground form. You may buy them, already ground, from super- markets and Indian and Pakistani grocers. You could also buy the whole seeds and grind them yourself in small quantities in an electric coffee-grinder. I like to put my home-ground coriander seeds through a sieve though this is not essential. Ground coriander seeds, if stored for several months, begin to taste a little like sawdust. It is best to discard them at this stage and start off with a fresh batch. These caraway-like seeds are used very frequently in Indian food, both in their whole and ground forms. The whole seeds are sold by Indian and Pakistani grocers and by some supermarkets. The ground seeds can be found in nearly all supermarkets. Whole seeds keep their flavour much longer and may be ground very easily in an electric coffee-grinder. Put 4- 5 tablespoons 0f whole cumin seeds into a small, heavy frying pan (cast-iron frying pans are best for this) and place the pan over a medium flame. No fat i~ necessary. Stir the seeds and keep roasting them until they turn a few shades darker. Soon you will be able to recognise the wonderful 'roasted' aroma that these seeds emit when they are ready. Store in an airtight container. Empty the roasted seeds into an electric coffee-grinder or other spice grinder and grind them finely. You could also use a pestle and mortar for this or else put the seeds between two sheets of brown paper and crush them SPICES, SEASONING AND FLAVOURINGS I7 Cumin seeds, black Shah zeera or Kala zeera Fennel seeds Sonf Garam masala with a rolling pin. Store ground roasted cumin seeds in a tightly lidded jar. These fine seeds, darker and more expensive than regular cumin seeds, are sold only by Indian and Pakistani grocers. They look like caraway seeds but have a gentle flavour. Buy them whole. If you cannot find them, use regular cumin seeds as a substitute. These seeds taste and look like amse seeds only they are larger, plumper, and milder. They give meat and vegetables a delicious, liquorice like flavour. They may be bought from some supermarkets and all Indian and Pakistani grocers. Indians often serve roasted fennel seeds at the end of a meal as a digestive and mouth freshener. This is an aromatic mixture that generally incorporates spices which are supposed to heat the body (the words mean 'hot spices') such as large black cardamoms, cinnamon, black cumin (also called shah zeera or royal cumin), cloves, black peppercorns and nutmeg. The mixture is used sparingly and is generally put into foods towards the end of their cooking period. It is also used as a garnish - a final aromatic flavouring sprinkled over cooked meats, vegetables and pulses. Garam masala is not a standardized spice mixture. Apart from the fact that there are many regional variations, I am sure that every North Indian and Pakistani home has its own family recipe. The recipe here happens to be one of my favourites. I have substituted seeds from the green cardamom pods for the more traditional black ones as I find their taste to be far more delicate.

However, you will find it quite pallid, as cheaper spices, such as cumin and coriander are often substituted for the more expensive cardamom and cloves. It is best to grind garam masafa in small quantities so that it stays fresh. My recipe makes about 3 tablespoons. Place all the ingredients in a clean, electric coffee-grinder (or any other spice grinder). Turn the machine on for 30- 40 seconds or until the spices are finely ground . Store in a small jar with a tight-fitting lid. Keep away from heat and sunlight. This is ginger that is dried and powdered, the same that you might use to make ginger bread. It is available in all supermarkets. This light brown, knobbly 'root' is not a root at all but a rhizome with a refreshing, pungent flavour. Its potato-like skin needs to be peeled away before it can be chopped, sliced, grated, or made into a paste. To grate ginger into a pulp, use the finest part of a hand grater. To grind ginger into a paste, chop it coarsely first and then throw it into the container of a food processor or blender. Add just enough water to make as smooth a paste as possible. SPICES, SEASONING AND FLAVOURINGS 19 Kalonji Mustard oil Sarson ka tel Mustard seeds, whole black Sarson Fresh ginger, a very common ingredient in Indian cooking, is now sold by many super- markets. It is certainly sold by all Asian grocers. When buying ginger, look for pieces that are not too wrinkled but have a taut skin. If you use ginger infrequently, 'store' ginger by planting it in a somewhat dry, sand y soil. Water it infrequentl y. Your ginger will not only survive, but will also sprout fresh knobs. Whenever you need some, dig it up, break off a knob, and then plant the rest again. If you use ginger frequently, store it in a cool, airy basket, along with your onions, potatoes, and garlic. This spice is a small, black, teardrop shaped onion seed with an appealing, earthy aroma. It is used for cooking vegetable and fish dishes in Bengal. The rest of the country uses it for pickling. Some north Indian breads such as naans have these seeds sprinkled on them before they are baked. Ka!onji is sold in Indian and Pakistani stores. This yellow oil made from mustard seeds is quite pungent when raw and amazingl y sweet when heated to a slight haze. It is used in Bengal and Kashmir for cooking vegetables and fish. It is the favourite oil throughout India for pickling. It is available only at Indian and Pakistani grocers. If you cannot find it, ground-nut oil may be substituted. Once you start using these seeds, you will not want to stop. They are round, tiny, and not really black but a dark reddish-brown colour. When scattered into hot oil they turn deliciously nutty. If you want to know what they taste like in isolation, make the carrot salad on page 171.

If a recipe calls for a third of a nutmeg, just hit a nutmeg lightly with a hammer. It is very soft and breaks quite easily. Saffron threads are the stigma of special crocuses that, in India, grow in the northern state of Kashmir. Saffron is expensive. It is used in festive dishes both for its saffron colour and its aroma. Yellow food colouring, or a small pinch of turmeric, may be substituted for the real thing even though purists would disapprove. To get the most colour and flavour out of saffron, Indians often roast the threads lightly in a heavy cast-iron frying pan and then crumble them into a small amount of hot milk. T his milk is then poured into rice and meat dishes as well as desserts. Saffron is sold in some supermarkets, all fi ne delicatessens and most Indian and Pakistani groceries. Powdered saffron is also available in selected shops. Amounts of salt given in recipes can be adjusted to suit individual tastes. I use the beige, unhulled seeds that are sold in all health food stores and all Oriental grocers. T hey have a wonderful, nu tty flavour, speci- all y after they have been roasted. SPICES, SEASON ING AND FLAVOURI NGS 2 I Turmeric Haldi Vark Vegetable oil Yell ow and red food colourings This is the spice that makes many Indian foods yellow. Apart from its mild, earthy flavour, it is used mainly because it is a digestive and an antisep.tic. Fresh turmeric looks like the baby sister of fresh ginger. They are both rhizomes. The only kind of turmeric I have seen in Britain is the dried variety. Buy the ground kind. Use it carefully as it can stain. It is sold in all supermarkets. This airy, real silver tissue is used for garnishing sweets as well as festive meat and rice dishes. It is sold only at some Indian and Pakistani grocers. Each silver tissue is packed between sheets of paper. Remove the top sheet carefully. Then pick up the next sheet with the vark on it and overturn it gently on the food you wish to garnish. Try not to let the vark disintegrate. It is edible. Store it in a tightly closed tin as it can tarnish. Most of my recipes call, rather generally, for vegetable oil. You could use what is labelled as vegetable oil in the supermarkets or you could use ground-nut oil, corn oil or sunflower oil. All would be quite suitable. These are used on some Indian foods - for instance these give Tandoori food its distinct- ive colouring. They are vegetable colourings and have no taste. However, one word of warning: a few people (and that includes me!) are allergic to the tartrazine contained in these colourings. 22 SPICES, SEASONING AND FLAVOURINGS TECHNIQUES 23 -------------------------- I ndian food is unique in its imaginative use of spices, seasonings, and flavourings. Many of our cooking techniques are really ways of getting these same spices, seasonings and flavourings to yield as great a variety of tastes and textures as possible. Spices and herbs do not have single, limited tastes. Depending upon how they are used - whole, ground, roasted, fried - they can be coaxed into producing a much larger spectrum than you might first imagine. Herein lies the genius oflndian cooking. It amuses me to find that many of the techniques used in the 'Nouvelle Cuisine' of France have been used in India for centuries. We are told that sauces can be made much lighter if they are thickened with ingredients other than flour. Flour is almost never used as a thickener for Indian sauces. Instead, we have used, very cleverly, I might add, ingredients such as onions, garlic, ginger, yoghurt and tomatoes. I think it might be useful, before you actually start cooking a recipe from this book, to measure and prepare all the ingredients you need for the recipe and have them ready near the cooker. Once you are experienced, this will not matter as much. But for those of you who are new to Indian cookery, it will help if you make all your pastes and do all your chopping and measuring before you start. The reason for this is that many Indian dishes require you to cook in one, flowing sweep. Ingredient follows ingredient, often swiftly. Frequently there is no time to stop and hunt for a spice that is hidden in the back of a cupboard. Something on the cooker might burn if you do. So organize yourself and read the recipe carefully. If many of the ingredients go into the pot at the same time, you can measure them out and keep them in the same bowl or plate. Here are some of the more commonly used techniques: 24 TECHNIQUES Clarified butter Ghee Dropping spices into hot oil Baghaar Not all Indian food is cooked in ghee, as some people imagine. Many of our foods are meant to be cooked in vegetable oil. But ghee does have a rich, nutty taste and a spoonful of it is frequently put on top of cooked pulses to enrich them and give them a silky smoothness. I must add here that there are certain families in India (not ours) who have always cooked in ghee. There used to be a certain amount of status attached to being able to say, 'We use nothing but pure ghee.' But today, even these families are coming around to using unsatu- rated fats. I feel that cooking in ghee is a bit like cooking in butter. It is fine to do it some of the time for certain selected dishes. Some of my recipes do call for ghee. I suggest you buy it, ready-made, from Asian grocers. However, if you wish to make it yourself, melt a pound of unsalted butter in a small, heavy pot over a low flame. Then let it simmer very gently for 10- 30 minutes. The length of the time will depend upon the amount of water in the butter. As soon as the white, milky residue turns to golden particles (you have to keep watching), strain the ghee through several layers of cheesecloth or a large handkerchief. Cool and then pour into a clean jar. Cover. Properly made ghee does not need refrigeration. I do not know of this technique being used anywhere else in the world. Oil (or ghee) is heated until it is extremely hot, but not burning. Then spices, generally whole ones, or else chopped up garlic and ginger, are added to the oil. The seasonings immediately begin to swell, brown, pop, or otherwise change character. This seasoned oil, together with all the spices in it, is then poured over cooked foods such as pulses and vegetables or TECHNIQUES 2 5 Grinding spices 26 TECHN IQUES else uncooked foods are added to it and then sauteed or simmered. The seasonings that are most commonly used for baghaar include whole cumin seeds, whole black mustard seeds, whole fenn el seeds, whole dried red chillies, whole cloves, cinnamon sticks, car- damom pods, bay leaves, black peppercorns, as well as chopped up garlic and ginger. Hot oil transforms them all and gives them a new, more concentrated character. When the whole spices used are large, such as bay leaves, cinnamon sticks or even cloves and pepper- corns, they are not meant to be eaten but are left to one side of the plate along with any bones. Many recipes call for ground spices. In India, we generally buy our spices whole and then grind them ourselves as we need them. They have much more fla vour this way. You probably already know the difference between freshly ground black pepper and ground pepper that has been sitting around for a month. The same applies to all spices. In India, the grinding of spices is generally done on heavy grinding stones. We, in our modern kitchens, can get the same results without the labour by using an electric coffee-grinder. It is best to grind limited quantities so that the spices do not lose their flavour. If you wipe the grinder carefully after use there will be no 'aftertaste' of spices to flavour your coffee beans. Buying ground spices is perfectly all right as long as you know that they will be less potent as time goes on. Before buying your spices, consult the preceding chapter to see which spices you must buy whole and which you may buy ground. Roasting spices Making thick sauces T his brings out yet another flavour from the spices. In my home, for example, we always make yoghurt relishes with cumin that has been roasted first and then ground. Nothing else will do. Ordinary ground cumin has a different flavour, quite unsuitable for putting into foods that are not going to be cooked. This roasting is best done in a heavy, cast iron frying pan since the pan can be heated without putting oil or water into it first. Whole spices are put into the pan. The pan is then shaken around until the spices turn a shade or two darker and emit their new 'roasted' aroma. You will begin to recognise it after you have done it a few times. Many of our meat, poultry, and fish dishes have thick, dark sauces. M y mother always said that the mark of a good chef was his sauce which depended not only on a correct balance of all the ingredients, but the correct frying (bhuno-ing) of these ingredients. As I stated earlier, there is no flour in these sauces. The 'body' comes, very often, from onions, garlic and ginger. The rich brown colour comes from frying all these ingredients properly. Very often, we make a paste of one or more of these ingredients first. In India, this is done on a grinding stone but in western kitchens it can be done easily in food processors and blenders, sometimes with the aid of a little water. Once the paste has been made, it needs to be browned or the sauce will not have the correct fla vour and colour. This is best done in a heavy pot, preferably non-stick, in a generous amount of oil. Remember that extra oil can always be spooned off the top once the dish has been cooked. TECHNIQUES 27 Browning sliced or chopped onions and garlic Adding yoghurt to sauces 28 TECHN IQ ES Sometimes a recipe requires that you brown thinly sliced or chopped onions. I have noticed that many of the students in my cookery classes stop half-way and when I point out to them that the onions are not quite done, they say 'Oh, but if we cook them more, they will burn. ' They will not, not if you watch. Start the frying on a medium-high flame and turn the heat down somewhat as the onions lose their water and begin to turn brown. They do need to be a rich reddish-brown colour or your sauce - if that is what they are intended for - will be pale and weak. The same goes for garlic. There is a common misconception that if garlic is allowed to pick up any colour at all, it will turn bitter. Actually, garlic tastes quite superb if it is chopped and allowed to fry in oil until it turns a medium-brown colour. I often cook courgettes this way - in oil that has been fla voured with browned garlic. Spinach and cauliflower tastes good this way too. In India, we say that such dishes are cooked with a garlic baghaar. A garlic baghaar can, of course, just be the first step in a recipe. More spices would be added later. Yoghurt adds a creamy texture and a delicate tartness to many of our sauces. But yoghurt curdles when it is heated. So when we add it to our browning sauces, we add just a tablespoon at a time. After a tablespoon of yoghurt has been put in, it is stirred and fried until it is absorbed and 'accepted' by the sauce. Then the next tablespoon is added. Peeling and chopping tomatoes Reducing sauces Cooking chicken without its skin Marinading Browning meats Many of my recipes call for peeled and chopped tomatoes. To peel them, bring a pot of water to a rolling boil. Drop in the tomatoes for I 5 seconds. Drain, rinse under cold water and peel. Now chop the tomatoes, making sure that you save all the juice that comes out of them. In India, we very rarely seed tomatoes. Many people do not even bother to peel them though I do feel that this improves the texture of a sauce. Sometimes meat is allowed to cook in a fairly thin, brothy sauce. Then the lid of the pot is removed and the sauce reduced over a fairly high flame until it is thick and clings to the meat. The meat has to be stirred frequently at this stage, so that it does not catch and burn. In India, we almost always remove the skin of the chicken before we cook it. The flavour of the spices penetrates the chicken much better this way and the entire dish is less fatty. It is very easy to remove the skin. Just hold it with kitchen paper so that it does not slip, and pull! We often cut deep gashes in large pieces of meat and leave them overnight in a marinade of yoghurt and seasonings. The yoghurt tenderises the meat while the gashes allow the flavour to penetrate deep inside the meat. After this, the meat can be grilled or baked faster than usual. In India, we generally do not brown cubes of meat by themselves but brown them with the sauce instead. I find this hard to do with British meats because they release far too much water as they cook. Indian meats tend to TECHNIQUES 29 --------- - -------- be very fresh and have far less water in them. So to avoid this problem I brown my meat a few pieces at a time in hot oil and set them aside. Once I have made the sauce, I add the browned meat cubes (and all the good juices that come out of them) and let them cook. These are just a few of the techniques that we use in Indian cookery. Others, that have to do with cooking rice or pulses, I shall deal with in later chapters. 30 TECHNIQUES MENUS AND HOW TO EAT INDIAN FOOD JI Wat do you eat with what? With each recipe in this book, I have suggested a menu. You do not have to follow it. After all, the fun of eating is to follo w your own palate and put together dishes that are con venient and exciting for you. G enerall y speaking, an Indian meal consists of a meat dish, a vegetable dish, bread and/or rice, a pulse dish, a yoghurt relish (or plain yoghurt), and a fresh chutney or small, relish-like salad . Pickles and preserved chutneys may be added if you have them. Fruit, rather than desserts are served at the end of a meal, although on festive occasions, sweets would not be at all amiss. Sometimes, when the meat dish is particularly elegant and rich, we eliminate th e pulse and serve an equally elegant pullao rice. Vegetarians - of whom there are millions in India - increase the number of vegetable and pulse dishes and always serve yoghurt in some form. W ithin this general framework, we try to see that the dishes we serve vary in colour, texture, and flavour. If the meat, for example, has a lot of sauce, then we often serve a 'dry', unsauced vegetable with it. If the vegetable we are serving is very soft - such as spinach - we make sure that there is a crunchy relish around on the table. M ost Indians like to eat with their hands. The more Westernised ones may use knives and forks or spoons and forks, or just forks, but they too succumb every now and then to the pleasure of eating with their fingers. It is only the right hand that is used for eating, the left being considered ' unclean'. W ith it, we break pieces of bread and then use the pieces to scoop up some meat or vegetable. W ith it, we also form neat morsels out of rice and other accompanying dishes and then transport them to our mouths. In the northern states such as U ttar Pradesh, this is done very delicately with just the tips of the fingers. In the south, almost the entire hand may be used. eedless to say, hands must be washed before and after eating. Even the humblest of roadside stalls catering to simple villagers and truck drivers would not consider offering food before offering a Iota (water vessel) of water for washing first. When we serve ourselves, we put most food s beside each other on our plates. Only very wet, flowing dishes are sometimes ladled on top of the rice but not on top of all the rice. Some of the rice is left plain to enable us to eat it with other dishes. Very wet dishes that are meant to be eaten with bread are served in small, individual bowls.

If you feel like making such a meal, then by all means, do it. On the other hand, there is no reason why you cannot serve an Indian vegetable with your roast lamb or eat an Indian meat (such as 'Chicken in a butter sauce', page 70) with French bread and a salad. If you are on a diet, you could make yourself a 'Yoghurt with cucumber and fresh mint' (page 162) for lunch and follow it with a crunchy apple. I have even served a roast leg of lamb with 'Black-eyed beans and mushrooms' (page 128), 'Simple buttery rice with onions' (page 149), and a green salad. It is an easy meal to put together and it is good. The colour photographs in this book show combinations of recipes to serve together for a variety of meals.

For those of you who already have a well equipped kitchen, the answer is probably 'no'. Good knives, sturdy pots with a good distribution of heat, rolling pins, graters, bowls, slotted spoons, pestle and mortar, frying pans - I am sure you have these already. There are, however, a few items that make the cooking of Indian food simpler. 38 EQU IPMENT An electric food processor or blender An electric coffee grinder Tongs Every Indian home has a grinding stone. This consists of a large flat stone that just sits and a smaller stone that is moved manually on top of it and does the actual grinding. These stones are exceedingly heavy. It is just as well that they are no longer essential. Their place, in modern kitchens, can be taken by food processors and blenders. Onions, garlic and ginger, formerly ground on grinding stones, can now be made into a paste in electrically powered machines. If you do not have a food processor or blender, then there are ways around it. Garlic, for example, may be mashed in a mortar or put through a garlic press. Ginger may be grated on the finest part of the grater. Onions can just be chopped very finely. Sometimes my recipe suggests putting water into the food processor while making the paste. If you have crushed the garlic and grated the ginger by hand, just put them into a bowl and add the amount of water in the recipe. If you decide to go out and buy a blender, make sure that its blades sit close to the bottom. Otherwise it will not pulverise small quantities adequately. Food processors and blenders cannot do all the work of an Indian grinding stone. Dry spices, for example, cannot be ground in them properly. For this, only a coffee-grinder will do. A coffee-grinder grinds spices in seconds and can then be wiped clean. If you do not have one, you will have to crush your spices in small quantities with a pestle and mortar. My favourite tongs are intended for barbecues but I use them for turning chicken pieces, picking up meat pieces when they are browning, and even for tossing a salad. EQUIPMENT 39 A large non-stick frying pan with a lid Small and large cast-iron frying pans Karhai Electric Rice Cookers 40 EQUIPMENT Non-stick pans really take the worry out of cooking many foods. Browning meats do not stick to the bottom, nor do sauces with ginger or almonds. As metal spoons ruin the finish of non-stick utensils, it is best to have a set of plastic or wooden ones. I keep a 5 inch (13 em) cast-iron frying pan for roasting spices - it can heat without oil or water in it - and for doing baghaar, frying small amounts of spices in oil. A larger cast- iron pan is excellent for making Indian breads such as parathas and chapatis. In India, these breads are cooked on a tava, a round, concave cast-iron plate. A large cast-iron frying pan makes the best substitute. This is very similar to a Chinese wok. If you took a large, hollow ball and cut it into half, that would be about the shape of a karhai. I am not suggesting that you go out and buy a karhai. I just wish to point out that for deep- frying, it is perhaps the most economical utensil as it allows you to use a relatively small quantity of oil while giving you enough depth in the centre of the utensil to submerge foods. A deep frying pan can be substituted for a karhai. If you frequently cook large quantities of rice, an electric rice cooker can be a useful piece of equipment. The cooker has a large covered pan which sits on top of an electric element. When the water has been absorbed by the rice, the cooker switches itself off, and will then keep the rice warm for several hours. The preparation of the rice and the amount of water you use are identical to the conventional methods of cooking rice (see page 144). MEAT 41 Lis chapter has a great variety of meat dishes in it, going from Kheema malar 'Minced lamb with peas' and 'Pork chops with chickpeas' that you may wish to cook for your family, to Raan masaledar - a whole leg of lamb garnished with almonds and raisins - which would impress the most blase of guests. There are a lot of lamb recipes. We do eat a fair amount oflamb in India. We also eat a lot of goat. As goat is hard to find in Britain, I have substituted lamb in its place. I love English lamb. I realise that it is a bit expensive but it does have excellent flavour. I find that the best cuts of lamb for stewing come from the neck and shoulder. Butchers have a way of trying to sell leg oflamb for stewing, mainly because it is easier to cut up. If you can, insist upon shoulder. You could buy a whole shoulder and carve up the meat yourself. Or you could buy shoulder chops and cut them up with a heavy cleaver. There is a lot of connective tissue in the shoulder and neck. This eventually makes for a moister meat. In India, we usually leave the bone in the meat when we are cooking any stew-type dish. In fact, we throw in a few extra marrow bones for good measure because they affect the taste and texture of the sauce. As children, we always fought for the marrow bones. The victor not only got to eat the marrow but to use the funny, long, silver marrow spoons that sat decoratively in the centre of our dining table. Many recipes in this book call for boned lamb. This is only because, over the years, I have seen many guests struggle with bones and have come to the conclusion that just because I like bones (I suck them), there is no reason to inflict them upon my guests. A majority of people who dine in our house seem to prefer boned meat. I leave the bone-in or bone-out decision up to you. Just remember that bones in stewing meat such as shoulder make up about 40 per cent of the total volume. If my recipe is for boned meat and you decide to leave the bone in, you might feed just half the number of people. In India, we frequently cook meat with vegetables such as potatoes and turnips. The vegetables absorb the taste of the meat and lend their own flavour to the sauce. I have included a few recipes for beef and pork as there are many communities in India which eat them. I, for one, simply love the beef baked with yoghurt and black pepper as well as the spicy and sour pork Vindaloo, a Goan speciality from India's west coast. 42 MEAT Minced lamb with mint Pudine wala kheema This dish, with its refreshing minty flavour, may be served very simply with rice, a pulse (such as 'Whole green lentils with spinach and ginger', page 125) and a yoghurt relish. I often use it to stuff tomatoes in the summer. If you wish to do this, get firm, good-sized tomatoes and slice off a cap at the top. Scoop out the inside without breaking the skin and then season the inside of the tomato generously with salt and pepper. Stuff it loosely with the mince, put the caps back on and bake the tomatoes in a gas mark 6, 400 °F (zoo °C) oven for about I 5 minutes or until the skin just begins to crinkle. Serve with rice and a salad. Serves 6: 6 oz (I75g) onions, peeled 8-9 cloves garlic, peeled A 2 inch by 1 inch (scm by 2.5cm) piece offresh ginger, peeled and coarsely chopped 2 tablespoons ground cumin seeds 3 tablespoons water 4 teaspoons ground coriander seeds 1 teaspoon ground turmeric !-1 teaspoon cayenne pepper 4 tablespoons vegetable oil 4 whole cardamom pods 6 whole cloves 2lb (9oog) minced lamb About I! teaspoons salt 2 oz (sog) finely chopped fresh mint leaves l teaspoon garam masala (page I8) 1! tablespoons lemon juice Chop half the onions finely and set them aside. Chop the other half coarsely and put them, along with the garlic, ginger, and 3 table- spoons water into the container of an electric blender. Blend until you have a smooth paste. Empty the paste into a small bowl. Add the cumin, coriander, turmeric and cayenne. Mix. Heat the oil in a 10 inch (25cm) frying pan over a high flame. When hot, put in the cardamom and cloves. Two seconds later, put in the finely chopped onions. Stir and fry them until they turn fairly brown. Turn the heat to medium and put in the spice mixture from the small bowl. Stir and fry for 3- 4 minutes. If the spice mixture sticks to the pan, sprinkle in a tablespoon of water and keep frying. Put in the minced meat. Break up all the lumps and stir the mince about until it loses all its pinkness. Stir and fry another minute after that. Add the salt and mix. Cover, turn heat to very low and let the mince cook in its own juices for 25 minutes. Remove the cover and spoon off most of the accumulated fat. Add the chopped mint, gar am masala, and lemon juice. Stir to mix and bring to a simmer. Cover, and simmer on very low heat for 3 minutes. N.B. The whole cardamom and cloves in this dish are not meant to be eaten. MEAT 43 Minced meat with peas Kheema matar I associate this dish with very pleasurable family picnics which we had, sometimes in the private compartments of slightly sooty, steam-engined trains, and sometimes in the immaculate public gardens of historic Moghul palaces. The mince, invariably at room temperature, was eaten with pooris or parathas that had been stacked tightly in aluminium containers. There was always a pickle, to perk things up, and some kind of onion relish as well. Serves 4-6: 4 tablespoons vegetable oil 3 oz (75g) onion, peeled and finely chopped 6-7 medium-sized cloves garlic peeled and finely chopped 1t lb (7oog) minced lamb (minced beef may be substituted) A 1 inch cube of fresh ginger, peeled and grated to a pulp 1-2 fresh, hot green chillies, minced 1 teaspoon ground coriander seeds 1 teaspoon ground cumin seeds !-*teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 pint (275ml) water 61 oz (qs-zoog) shelled peas 4-6 heaped tablespoons chopped, fresh green coriander About 1! teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon garam masala (page I8) About 1! tablespoons lemon juice 44 MEAT Heat the oil in a wide, medium-sized pan over a medium-high flame. When hot, put in the onions. Stir and fry them until they are lightly browned. Add the garlic. Stir and fry for another minute. Now put in the mince, ginger, green chillies, ground coriander seeds, cumin and cayenne. Stir and fry the meat for 5 minutes, breaking up lumps as you do so. Add 6 f1 oz (175ml) of the water and bring to a boil. Cover, turn heat to low, and simmer for 30 minutes. Add the peas, fresh coriander, salt, garam masafa, lemon juice, and the remaining 4 f1 oz (10oml) water. Mix and bring to a simmer. Cover and cook on low heat another 10 minutes or until peas are tender. Taste seasonings and adjust balance of salt and lemon juice if you need to. A lot of fat might have collected at the bottom of your pan. Whenever you get ready to serve, lift the mince and peas out of the fat with a slotted spoon. Do not serve the fat. Kashmiri meatballs Kashmiri koftas These sausage-shaped 'meatballs' taste very Kashmiri in their final blend of flavours. I often serve them with 'Plain basmati rice' (page 147), 'Red split lentils' (page 122), and 'Carrot and onion salad' (page 171). Serves 6: 2lb (9oog) minced lamb A piece of fresh ginger, about 1! inches (4cm) long and 1 inch (2.5cm) thick, peeled and finely grated 1 tablespoon ground cumin seeds 1 tablespoon ground coriander seeds l teaspoon ground cloves l teaspoon ground cinnamon l teaspoon grated nutmeg l teaspoon freshly ground black pepper !-!teaspoon cayenne pepper About I! teaspoons salt 5 tablespoons plain yoghurt 7-8 tablespoons vegetable oil A 2 inch (z.scm) stick of cinnamon s-6 whole cardamom pods 2 bay leaves s-6 whole cloves 8 fl oz (225ml) warm water Combine the lamb, ginger, cumin, coriander, ground cloves, ground cinnamon, grated nutmeg, black pepper, cayenne, salt and 3 tablespoons of the yoghurt in a bowl. Mix well. Wet your hands with cold water and form 24 long koftas - sausage shapes, about 2t- 3 (6- 7.scm) inches long and about 1 inch (2.scm) thick. Heat the oil in a large, preferably non-stick frying pan (or use two frying pans). When hot, put in the cinnamon stick, cardamom pods, bay leaves and whole cloves. Stir for a second. Now put in the koftas in a single layer and fry them on medium-high heat until they are lightly browned on all sides. Beat the remain- ing yoghurt into the 8 fl oz (225ml) warm water. Pour this over the koftas and bring to a boil. Cover, lower heat and simmer for about half an hour, turning the koftas around gently every 7- 8 minutes. By the end of the half hour, no liquid other than the fat should be left in the frying pan. If necessary, turn up the heat to achieve this. When you get ready to serve, lift the koftas out of the fat with a slotted spoon. Leave the whole spices behind as well. MEAT 45 Lamb with onions Do piaza This is an elegant dish that may be made as mild or as hot as you like. It is cooked with a fair amount of oil but most of this is skimmed off the top before serving. There are s0me whole spices in it - cloves, cardamom and cinnamon - which are not meant to be eaten. They should be pushed to the side as and when you come across them on your plates. Lamb with onions may be served with rice or a bread. 'Spicy green beans' (page 103) also go well with it. Serves 6: 4 good-sized onions, peeled 7 cloves garlic, peeled A 1 inch (2.5cm) cube of fresh ginger, coarsely chopped i pint (425ml) water 1O tablespoons vegetable oil A 1 inch (2.5cm) stick of cinnamon 1O whole cardamom pods 1O whole cloves 2! lb (Ikg 125g) boned lamb, preferably from the shoulder, cut into 1 inch (2.5cm) cubes (with most of the fat removed) 1 tablespoon ground coriander seeds 2 teaspoons ground cumin seeds 6 tablespoons plain yoghurt, beaten lightly !-!teaspoon cayenne pepper About I} teaspoons salt ! teaspoon garam masala (page 18) Cut three of the onions into halves, lengthwise and then cut them, crosswise, into very fine half rings. Chop the fourth onion finely. Keep the two types of onion separate. Put the garlic and ginger into the container of an electric blender or food processor. Add 4 fl oz (room!) of the measured water and blend until fairly smooth. Heat the oil in a wide, heavy saucepan over a medium-high flame. When hot, put in the finely sliced onions. Stir and fry for 10- 12 minutes or until the onions turn a nice, reddish-brown colour. You may have to turn the heat down somewhat towards the end of this cooking period. Remove the onions with a slotted spoon and spread them on a plate lined with paper towels (or clean brown paper). Put the cinnamon, cardamom and cloves into the hot oil. Stir them about for about 5 seconds over medium-high heat. Now put in 8- ro cubes of meat or as many as the saucepan will hold easily in a single, loosely packed layer. Brown the meat on one side. Turn it over and brown the opposite side. Remove the meat cubes with a slotted spoon and put them in a bowl. Brown all the meat this way, removing each batch as it gets done. Put\" the chopped onion into the remaining oil in the saucepan. Stir and fry it on medium heat until the pieces turn brown at the edges. Add the garlic-ginger paste. Stir and fry it Kashmiri lamb stew Kashmiri yakhni until all the water in it seems to boil away and you see the oil again. Turn the heat down a bit and add the coriander and cumin. Stir and fry for 30 seconds. Now add 1 tablespoon of the yoghurt. Stir and fry until it is incorporated into the sauce. Add an0ther tablespoon of yoghurt. Stir and fry, incorporating this into the sauce as well. Add all the yoghurt this way, a tablespoon at a time. Now put in all the meat and any accumulated juices in the meat bowl with the remaining water, the cayenne and the salt. Stir to mix and bring to a simmer. Cover, turn heat to low and cook for about 45 minutes or until the lamb is tender. Add the fried onions and the garam masala. Stir to mix. Cook, uncovered, for another 2- 3 minutes, stirring gently as you do so. Turn off the heat and let the pan sit for a while. The fat will rise to the top. Remove it with a spoon. N.B. This dish may be prepared ahead of time and reheated. Some Kashmiri dishes are fiercely hot, others mild and soothing. Often, they are served together at the same meal. For those of you who are unused to very spicy foods, this might be the perfect dish to try first. It is really a lamb stew - with lots of lovely fennel flavour but no hot chillies - that is eventually thickened with yoghurt so it has a creamy tartness. You could serve it with plain rice, as Kashmiris do. MEAT 47 Serves 4-6: 4 teasp00ns whole fennel seeds 6 tablespoons vegetable oil or ghee A pinch of ground asafetida, optional 3lb (xkg 3sog) shoulder of lamb boned or unboned, cut roughly into 2 inch (scm) cubes A 1 inch (z.scm) stick of cinnamon 10 whole cardamom pods 1S whole cloves It teaspoons salt- or to taste x! pints (84sml) water x! teaspoons dried ginger powder IS fl oz (4zsml) plain yoghurt ! teaspoon garam masala (page 18) 48 MEAT Put the fennel seeds into a clean coffee grinder or other spice grinder and grind until you have a powder. Heat the oil in a heavy, wide pot over high heat. When hot, put in the asafetida. One second later, put in all the meat, as well as the cinnamon, cardamom, cloves and salt. Stir and cook, uncovered, over high heat for about 5 minutes or until almost all the water released by the meat disappears and the meat browns very lightly. Lower the heat to medium and add 1 tablespoon water, the fennel and ginger. Stir to mix. Add It pints (845ml) water, cover partially, and simmer on medium heat for 30 minutes. Cover completely, turn heat to low and simmer for 40 minutes or until the meat is tender. Stir a few times as the meat cooks, adding a few tablespoons of water if it seems to dry out. Beat the yoghurt in a bowl until it is smooth and creamy. Remove the cover from the meat pot and turn the heat to medium-low. Push the meat cubes to the edges of the pot, leaving a well- like space in the centre. Pour the yoghurt very slowly into this well, while moving a slotted spoon back and forth quite fast in the same area. (If you do not do this, the yoghurt will curdle.) Keep up the back and forth move- ment of the slotted spoon for a good 5 minutes after all the yoghurt has been poured in. You should now have a simmering, creamy sauce. Cover partially and continue to cook on medium-low heat for another IO minutes. Sprinkle in the gar am mas ala and mix. N.B. The whole spices in the stew are not meant to be eaten. l ____________________________________________ __ Lamb with spinach Dilli ka saag gosht This dish could also be made with beef. Use cubed chuck steak and cook it for about 2 hours or until it is tender. Dilli ka saag gosht may be served with rice or bread. I think 'Fried aubergine slices' (page 99) and a yoghurt dish would complement the meat well. Serves 6: 8 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 teasp00n whole black peppercorns 6--'] whole cloves 2 bay leaves 6 cardamom pods 6 oz (175g) onions, peeled and finely chopped 6-8 cloves garlic, peeled and finely chopped A 1 inch (2.5cm) cube of ginger, peeled and finely chopped 2 lb (9oog) boned meat from lamb shoulder, cut into 1 inch (2.5cm) cubes 2 teaspoons ground cumin seeds 1 teaspoon ground coriander seeds ±-i teaspoon cayenne pepper 2 teaspoons salt 5 tablespoons plain yoghurt, well beaten 2lb (9oog) fresh spinach, trimmed, washed and finely chopped or 2 lb (9oog) frozen spinach, thawed out, may be substituted ± teaspoon garam masala (page I8) Heat the oil in a large pot over a medium-high flame. When hot, put in the peppercorns, cloves, bay leaves, and cardamom pods. Stir for a second. Now put in the onions, garlic, and ginger. Stir and fry until the onions develop brown specks. Now add the meat, ground cumin, ground coriander, cayenne pepper, and 1 teaspoon of the salt. Stir and fry for a minute. Add 1 tablespoon of the beaten yoghurt. Stir and fry for another minute. Add an0ther tablespoon of the yoghurt. Stir and fry for a minute. Keep doing this until all the yoghurt has been incorporated. The meat should also have a slightly browned look. Add the spinach and the remaining 1 teaspoon salt. Stir to mix. Keep stirring and cooking until the spinach wilts completely. Cover tightly and simmer on low heat for about I hour IO minutes or until meat is tender. Remove the lid and add the gar am mas ala. Turn the heat to medium. Stir and cook another 5 minutes or until most (but not all) the water in the spinach disappears and you have a thick, green sauce. N.B. The whole spices m this dish are not meant to be eaten. MEAT 49 ---------------------------------- Beef baked with yoghurt and black pepper Dumgosht Ever since the Moghuls came to India, there has been a method of cooking that Indians refer to as 'dum'. Meat (or rice for that matter) is partially cooked in a heavy pot and then covered over with a flat lid. At this stage the pot and lid are sealed with a 'rope' made out of very stiff dough. The pot is placed over a gentle fire - generally the last of the charcoals - and more hot charcoals are spread over the lid. The meat proceeds to cook very slowly until it is tender, often in small amounts ofliquid. In today's world, this dum method of cooking is the equivalent of slow oven baking. So what I have done here is to update a very traditional, top-of- the-cooker, Moghul recipe, modernising it just enough to suit our contemporary kitchens. As with many other dum foods, this is not a dish with a lot of sauce. Ideally, whatever sauce there is should be thick and cling to the meat. If you like, you could leave out the cayenne in this recipe. That is probably what the early Moghuls did. The later Moghuls, seduced by the chilli peppers brought over from the New World by the Portuguese, used it generously. I love to eat this meat dish with chapatis or parathas or naans. If you prefer rice, then the more moist pullaos, such as 'Mushroom pullao' (page 1 52), would be the perfect accompaniment. You could also make this dish with stewing lamb meat from the shoulder. 50 MEAT · ~ · ·· ~ ·~ . ·~ •• •• o. •o o• •• •• 0 • Serves 4- 6: 6 tablespoons vegetable oil zlb (9oog) boneless stewing beef from the neck and shoulder, cut into 1! inch (4crn} cubes ! lb (zzsg) onions, peeled and very finely chopped 6 cloves garlic, peeled and very finely chopped ! teaspoon dried, powdered ginger k-! teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 tablespoon paprika 2 teaspoons salt ! teaspoon very coarsely ground black pepper IO fl oz (275rnl) plain yoghurt, beaten lightly Preheat oven to gas mark 4 or 350 °F (180 °C). Heat the oil in a wide, flameproof casserole- type pot over a medium-high flame. When hot, put in as many meat pieces as the pot will hold easily in a single layer. Brown the meat pieces on all sides and set them aside in a deep plate. Brown all the meat this way. Put the onions and garlic into the same pot and turn the heat down to medium. Stir and fry the onion-garlic mixture for about 10 minutes or until it has browned. Now put in the browned meat as well as any juices that might have accumulated in the plate. Also put in the ginger, cayenne, paprika, salt, and pepper. Stir for a minute. Now put in the yoghurt and bring to a simmer. Cover tightly, first with aluminium foil and then with a lid, and bake in the oven for rt hours. The meat should be tender by now. If it is not tender, pour in 5 fl oz ( 1 soml) of boiling water, cover tightly, and bake another 20- 30 minutes or until meat is tender. Stir meat gently before servmg. Red lamb or beef stew Rogan josh Rogan j osh gets its name from its rich, red appearance. The red appearance, in turn, is derived from ground red chillies, which are used quite generously in this recipe. If you want your dish to have the right colour and not be very hot, combine paprika with cayenne pepper in any proportion that you like. Just make sure that your paprika is fresh and has a good red colour. There are many recipes for ragan josh. This is probably the simplest of them all. It may be served with an Indian bread or rice. A green bean or aubergine dish would be a perfect accompaniment. MEAT 51 ,.--------------------- - - · - Serves 4-6: Two 1 inch (2.5cm) cubes of fresh ginger, peeled and coarsely chopped 8 cloves garlic, peeled 4 tablespoons plus !-i pint (275-425ml) water 1O tablespoons vegetable oil 2 lb (9oog) boned meat from lamb shoulder or leg, or stewing beef (chuck), cut into 1 inch (2.5cm) cubes 1O whole cardamom pods 2 bay leaves 6 whole cloves 1O whole peppercorns A 1 inch (2.5cm) stick of ctnnamon 7 oz (2oog) onions, peeled and finely chopped 1 teaspoon ground coriander seeds 2 teaspoons ground cumin seeds 4 teaspoons bright red paprika mixed with *-1 teaspoon cayenne pepper I} teaspoons salt 6 tablespoons plain yoghurt } teaspoon garam masala (page I8) Freshly ground black pepper 52 MEAT Put the ginger, garlic, and 4 tablespoons water into the container of an electric blender. Blend well until you have a smooth paste. Heat the oil in a wide, heavy pot over a medium-high flame. Brown the meat cubes in several batches and set to one side. Put the cardamom, bay leaves, cloves, peppercorns, and cinnamon into the same hot oil. Stir once and wait until the cloves swell and the bay leaves begin to take on colour. This just takes a few seconds. Now put in the onions. Stir and fry for about 5 minutes or until the onions turn a medium-brown colour. Put in the ginger- garlic paste and stir for 30 seconds. Then add the coriander, cumin, paprika-cayenne, and salt. Stir and fry for another 30 seconds. Add the fried meat cubes and juices. Stir for 30 seconds. Now put in 1 tablespoon of the yoghurt. Stir and fry for about 30 seconds or until the yoghurt is well blended. Add the remaining yoghurt, a tablespoon at a time, in the same way. Stir and fry for another 3- 4 minutes. Now add t pint (275ml) of water if you are cooking lamb and i pint (425ml) water if you are cooking beef. Bring the contents of the pot to a boil, scraping in all browned spices on the sides and bottom of the pot. Cover, turn heat to low and simmer for about an hour if you are cooking lamb and 2 hours if you are cooking beef, or until meat is tender. (The meat could also be baked, covered in a preheated gas mark 4, 350°F (18o 0 C) oven for the same length of time or until tender.) Every 10 minutes or so, give the meat a good stir. When the meat is tender, take off the lid, turn the heat up to medium, and boil away some of the liquid. You should end up with tender meat in a thick, reddish-brown sauce. All the fat that collects in the pot may be spooned off the top Sprinkle the garam masala and black pepper over the meat before you serve and mix them in. Kashmiri red lamb stew Kashmiri ragan josh Kashmiri Hindus do not eat any onions or garlic and they often use dry, powdered ginger instead of the fresh kind. This is their very different and quite delicious version of rogan josh. (For more on rogan josh, see the introduction to the preceding recipe.) I have left the bones in the meat this time as most Indians really prefer their meat this way. Kashmiri rogan josh may be served with 'Frozen spinach with potatoes' (page II6), plain long- grain rice and a relish. Serves 4-6: 1 tablesp00n whole fennel seeds 25 fl oz (72oml) plain yoghurt 6 tablespoons vegetable oil A i inch (2cm) stick of cinnamon ! teasp00n whole cloves A pinch of ground asafetida, optional 3 lb (1kg 350g) stewing meat (with bone) from lamb shoulder and neck, cut into 2 inch (scm) cubes 2! teaspoons salt - or to taste 4 teaspoons bright red paprika mixed with !-1 teaspoon cayenne pepper 1! teaspoons dried ginger powder I! pints (845ml) water ~ teaspoon garam masala (page I8) Put the fennel seeds into the container of a spice grinder or clean coffee grinder and grind until fine. Put the yoghurt in a bowl and beat it with a fork or a whisk until it is smooth and creamy. Heat the oil in a large pot over a high flame. When hot, put in the cinnamon and cloves. A second later, put in the ground asafetida. A second after that, put in all the meat and the salt. Stir the meat and cook, still on a high flame, for about 5 minutes. Now put in the paprika and cayenne and give the meat a good stir. Slowly add the yoghurt, 4- 5 fl oz (Ioo- Isoml) at a time stirring the meat vigorously as you do so. Add all the yoghurt this way. Keep cooking on high heat until all the liquid has boiled away and the meat pieces have browned slightly. Add the fennel and ginger. Give the meat some more good stirs. Now put in It pints (845ml) water, cover so as to leave the lid very slightly ajar, and cook on medium heat for 30 minutes. Cover complete- ly and cook on low heat for another 45 minutes or until meat is tender. Stir a few times as the meat cooks, making sure that there is always some liquid in the pot. Remove the lid and add the gar am masala. You should have a thick reddish brown sauce. If it is too thin boil some of the liquid away. MEAT 53 Delhi-style lamb cooked with potatoes Aloo gosht This is one of the everyday meat dishes that I grew up with in Delhi. I still love its homey taste and have a particular weakness for its sauce, which seems to combine all the goodness of lamb, potatoes, tomatoes, and the cheaper, commoner Indian spices - cumin, coriander, turmeric, and cayenne pepper. I like it with rice or an Indian bread and 'Gujerati-style green beans' (page 102). Serves 6: 7 tablespoons vegetable oil 6 oz (I75g) onions, peeled and finely chopped !-I fresh green chilli, finely chopped 5 cloves garlic, peeled and finely chopped 2t lb(Ikg)boned lamb meat from the shoulder, cut into 1 inch (z.scm) cubes I2 oz (35og) fresh tomatoes, peeled (see page 29) and finely chopped (tinned tomatoes may be substituted) 1 tablespoon ground cumin seeds 2 teaspoons ground coriander seeds ! teaspoon ground turmeric i-1 teaspoon cayenne pepper 2 teaspoons salt 1 lb (45og) medium-sized potatoes, peeled and cut into half 54 MEAT Heat the oil in a large, heavy pot over a high flame. When hot, put in the onions, green chilli, and garlic. Stir and fry until the onions have browned slightly. Put in the meat and stir it about vigorously for about 5 minutes. Now put in the tomatoes, cumin, coriander, turmeric, cayenne pepper and salt. Continue to stir and cook on high heat for IO- I 5 minutes or until the sauce is thick and the oil seems to separate from it. Add the potatoes and rt pints (845ml) water. Cover, leaving the lid just very slightly ajar, and cook on medium-low heat for about I hour 10 minutes or until the meat is tender and the sauce is thick. Mughlai lamb with turnips Shabdeg Turnips are perhaps the most under-rated vegetable in the world. This classical Moghul recipe calls for small, whole turnips. The turnips end up by absorbing all the delicious meat juices, turning buttery soft and yet retaining their own rather pretty shape. I like to serve this dish with 'Mushroom pullao' (page I 52) and 'Spicy green beans' (page I03). Dal and a yoghurt relish can also be added to the meal. Serves 6: IO small turnips, weighing 1! lb (7oog) without leaves and stems (if your turnips are larger, halve them) 2} teaspoons salt 1 lb (450g) onions, peeled 8 tablespoons vegetable oil 2t lb (I kg) stewing meat (with bone) from lamb shoulder, cut into 1! inch (4cm) cubes IO fl oz (275ml) plain yoghurt A 1 inch piece of fresh ginger, peeled and very finely chopped ! teaspoon ground turmeric ! teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 tablespoon ground coriander seeds 4 pints (2.25 litres) water ! teaspoon garam masala (page I8) Peel the turnips and prick them all over with a fork. Put them in a bowl and rub them with i teaspoon salt. Set aside for It - 2 hours. Cut the onions in half, lengthwise, and then crosswise into very thin slices. Heat the oil in a large, wide, and preferably non-stick pot over a medium-high flame. When hot, put in the onions. Stir and fry for about I2 minutes or until the onions are a reddish-brown colour. Remove the onions with a slotted spoon, squeezing out and leaving behind as much oil as you can. Spread the onions out on a plate. Put the meat into the same pot. Also put in the yoghurt, ginger and 1 teaspoon salt. Stir and bring to a boil. Turn the heat up high. You should, at this stage, have a fair amount of rather thin sauce. Cook on high heat, stirring every now and then, for about IO minutes or until the sauce is fairly thick and you just begin to see the oil. Turn the heat down a bit to medium-high and continue to stir and fry for 5- 7 minutes or until the meat is lightly browned and the sauce has disappeared. Turn the heat to medium-low. Put in the turmeric, cayenne, and ground coriander. Stir for a minute. Now put in 4 pints (2.25litres) water and 1 teaspoon salt. Drain the turnips and add them as well. Bring the pot to a boil. Turn the heat to medium-high and cook, uncovered, for about 45 minutes or until you have less than a MEAT 55 ----- ----· ---- third of the liquid left. Stir several times during this cooking period. Put in the browned onions and the garam masala. Stir gently to mix and turn heat to low. Cook gently, uncovered, for another 10 minutes. Stir a few times during this period, taking care not to break the turnips. Spoon off the oil that floats to the top and serve hot. 'Royal' lamb or beef with a creamy almond sauce Shahi korma There are many Indian dishes that were inspired, a few centuries ago, by dishes from other countries. Shahi karma - lamb cubes smothered in a rich almond and cream sauce - owes its ancestry to Persian food. It could be served with rice (perhaps 'Spiced basmati rice', page 148) or a bread (naan, chapati, or paratha) and a vegetable such as 'Cauliflower with potatoes', (page 109). It would be good to have some kind of tomato or onion relish on the side. When I want a quick, but elegant, meal, I have been known to serve shahi karma with plain rice and a crisp green salad. In my recipe here, I have cooked shahi karma the traditional way, that is on top of the cooker. If you like, you could do the final long cooking in the oven. This is particularly useful if you are making a large meal and need the top of the cooker for other dishes. Just preheat the oven to gas mark 4, 350°F (18o°C) and, once you have combined the meat, salt, cream and water and brought it to a boil, you can cover the pot and put it in the oven instead. The cooking times and other general directions remain the same. S6 MEAT Serves 4-6: 8 cloves garlic, peeled A 1 inch (2.5cm) cube of fresh ginger, peeled and coarsely chopped 2 oz (sog) blanched, slivered almonds 6 tablespoons plus 4-8 floz (10o-225ml) water 7 tablespoons vegetable oil 2lb(9oog)bonedlamb from the shoulder or leg or stewing beef(chuck), cut into 1 inch (2.5cm) cubes 1O whole cardamom pods 6 whole cloves A 1 inch (2.5cm) stick of Cinnamon 7 oz (2oog) onions, peeled and finely chopped 1 teaspoon ground coriander seeds 2 teaspoons ground cumin seeds ! teaspoon cayenne pepper I! teaspoons salt ! pint (275ml) single cream ! teaspoon garam masala (page 18) Put the garlic, ginger, almonds, and 6 table- spoons of the water into the container of an electric blender. Blend until you have a paste. Heat the oil in a wide, heavy, preferably non-stick pot over a medium-high flame. When hot, put in just enough meat pieces so they lie, uncrowded, in a single layer. Brown the meat pieces on all sides, then remove them with a slotted spoon and put them in a bowl. Brown all the meat this way. Put the cardamom, cloves, and cinnamon into the hot oil. Within seconds the cloves will expand. Now put in the onions. Stir and fry the onions until they turn a brownish colour. Turn the heat down to medium. Put in the paste from the blender as well as the coriander, cumin, and cayenne. Stir and fry this mixture for 3- 4 minutes or until it too has browned somewhat. Now put in the meat cubes as well as any liquid that might have accumulated in the meat bowl, the salt, the cream, and 4 fl oz (Iooml) water. If you are cooking beef, add another 4 fl oz (1ooml) water. Bring to a boil. Cover, turn heat to low and simmer lamb for I hour and beef for 2 hours or until the meat is tender. Stir frequently during this cooking period. Skim off any fat that floats to the top. Sprinkle in the garam masala and mix. N.B. The whole spices in this dish are not meant to be eaten. Whole leg of lamb in a spicy yoghurt sauce Raan masaledar If you are having guests for dinner, this might be the perfect dish to serve. It is quite impressive - a whole leg dressed with a rich sauce, served garnished with almonds and sultanas. I often serve it with 'Sweet yellow rice' (page I 57) and a green vegetable. MEAT 57 You need to buy a sib (zkg) leg of lamb. Get the butcher to remove the H bone and to make a deep pocket to holCl a stuffing. (You will not actually stuff the leg but most butchers seem to understand 'stuffing' better than they do 'spice paste'.) Also, ask the butcher to cut the protruding leg bone as close to the end of the meat as possible. This is to enable you to fit it into your baking pan easily. Ask the butcher to remove all the fat on the outside of the leg as well as the parchment like skin. (You could, of course, do this yourself.) For baking, you need a pan large enough to hold the leg easily and about 2- 2± inches (s- 6cm) deep to hold the sauce. Ideally, the pan should have a lid but you can use aluminium foil instead. Pyrex and stainless steel baking pans are best as they do not affect the taste of the sauce. Serves 4-6: A 5 Ib (2.25kg) leg oflamb, trimmed (see above) For the sauce: 2 oz (sog) blanched almonds ! Ib (225g) onions, peeled and coarsely chopped 8 cloves garlic, peeled Four 1 inch (2.5cm) cubes of ginger, peeled and coarsely chopped 4 fresh hot green chillies, coarsely chopped 20 fl oz (570ml) plain yoghurt 2 tablespoons ground cumin seeds 4 teaspoons ground coriander seeds ! teaspoon cayenne pepper 3! teaspoons salt ! teaspoon garam masala (page I8) 6 tablespoons vegetable oil ! teasp00n whole cloves I 6 cardamom pods A 2 inch (scm) stick of cinnamon IO black peppercorns S8 MEAT Make sure that all the fat has been trimmed from the outside of the leg and that most of the fell (parchment-like white skin) has been pulled off. Put the leg in a baking dish made, preferably, of pyrex or stainless steel. Put the 2 oz (sag) almonds, onions, garlic, ginger, green chillies, and 3 tablespoons of the yoghurt into the container of a food processor or blender and blend until you have a paste. Put the remaining yoghurt into a bowl. Beat lightly with a fork or a whisk until it is smooth and creamy. Add the paste from the processor, the cumin, coriander, cayenne, salt, and garam masala. Mix. Push some of the spice paste into all the openings in the lamb. Be quite generous about this. Spread the paste evenly on the underside of the leg (the side that originally had less fat). Now, using a small, sharp, pointed knife (such as a paring knife), make deep slashes in the meat and push in the spice paste with your fingers. Turn the leg over so its outer side (the side that was once covered with fat) is on top. Spread a very thick layer of paste over it. Again, make deep slashes with the knife and push the spice paste into the slashes. Pour all the remaining spice paste over and around the meat. Cover with plastic cling film and refrigerate for 24 hours. For garnishing: 4 tablespoons sultanas ! oz (wg) blanched, split or slivered almonds Take the baking dish with the meat out of the refrigerator and let the meat come to room temperature. Remove the cling film. Heat the oil in a small frying pan over a medium flame. When hot, put in the cloves, cardamom, cinnamon and peppercorns. When the cloves swell - this just takes a few seconds - pour the hot oil and spices over the leg oflamb. Preheat oven to gas mark 6, 400°F (200°C). Cover the baking dish tightly either with its own lid or with a large piece of aluminium foil. Bake, covered, for I hour 30 minutes. Remove the foil and bake uncovered for 45 minutes. Baste 3- 4 times with the sauce during this period. Scatter, or arrange in a pattern, the sultanas and the t OZ (I 5g) almonds over the top of the leg and bake for another s- 6 minutes. Remove the baking dish from the oven and let it sit in a warm place for I 5 minutes. Take the leg out of the pan and set it on a warm platter. Spoon off all the fat from the top of the sauce. Use a slotted spoon and fish out all the whole spices in the sauce. Discard the spices. Pour the sauce around the leg. Goan-style hot and sour pork Vindaloo The Hindus and Muslims of Indi~ do not, generally, eat pork - but Indian Christians do. This dish, with its semi-Portuguese name suggesting that the meat is cooked with wine (or vinegar) and garlic, is a contribution from the Konkani-speaking Christians of western India. Vindaloos, which may be made out of lamb and beef as well, are usually very, very hot. You can control this heat by putting in just as many red chillies as you think you can manage. Serve mounds of fluffy rice on the side. MEAT 59 Serves 6: 2 teasp00ns whole cumin seeds 2-3 hot, dried red chillies 1 teaspoon black peppercorns 1 teaspoon cardamom seeds (you may take the seeds out of pods if you cannot buy them loose) A 3 inch (2cm) stick of ctnnamon I! teasp00ns whole black mustard seeds 1 teasp00n whole fenugreek seeds 5 tablespoons white wine vmegar I!-z teaspoons salt 1 teaspoon light brown sugar 1O tablespoons vegetable oil 61 oz (17s-2oog) onions, peeled and sliced into fine half-rings 4-6 tablespoons plus 8 f1 oz (225ml) water zlb (9oog) boneless pork shoulder meat, cut into 1 inch (2.5cm) cubes A 1 inch (2.5cm) cube of fresh ginger, peeled and coarsely chopped A small, whole head of garlic, with all the cloves separated and peeled (or the equivalent, if using a large one) 1 tablespoon ground coriander seeds ! teaspoon ground turmeric 6o MEAT Grind cumin seeds, red chillies, peppercorns, cardamom seeds, cinnamon, black mustard seeds and fenugreek seeds in a coffee-grinder or other spice grinder. Put the ground spices in a bowl. Add the vinegar, salt and sugar. Mix and set aside. Heat the oil in a wide, heavy pot over a medium flame. Put in the onions. Fry, stirring frequently, until the onions turn brown and crisp. Remove the onions with a slotted spoon and put them into the container of an electric blender or food processor. (Turn the heat off.) Add 2- 3 tablespoons of water to the blender and puree the onions. Add this puree to the ground spices in the bowl. (This is the vindaloo paste). It may be made ahead of time and frozen.) Dry off the meat cubes with a paper towel and remove large pieces of fat, if any. Put the ginger and garlic into the container of an electric blender or food processor. Add 2- 3 tablespoons of water and blend until you have a smooth paste. Heat the oil remaining in the pot once again over a medium-high flame. When hot, put in the pork cubes, a few at a time, and brown them lightly on all sides. Remove each batch with a slotted spoon and keep in a bowl. Do all the pork this way. Now put the ginger- garlic paste into the same pot. Turn down the heat to medium. Stir the paste for a few seconds. Add the coriander and turmeric. Stir for another few seconds. Add the meat, any juices that may have accumulated as well as the vindaloo paste and 8 fl oz (225ml) water. Bring to a boil. Cover and simmer gently for an hour or until pork is tender. Stir a few times during this cooking period. Pork chipolatas cooked in an Indian style Indians cannot, of course, buy chipolatas in their local bazaars but here is a simple Indian-style recipe that I use when I am rushed to get dinner on the table. 'Potatoes with black pepper' (page I I 3) may be served on the side. Serves 4: A r inch (2.5cm) cube of fresh ginger, peeled and coarsely chopped 3 cloves garlic, peeled 4 tablespoons water ! lb (225g) small courgettes 2 tablespoons vegetable oil ! lb (225g) pork chipolatas 4 oz (11og) onion, peeled and chopped 1 teaspoon ground cumin seeds l teaspoon cayenne pepper ! lb (225g) tomatoes, peeled (see page 29) and finely chopped (you may use an 8 oz (225g) can of tomatoes as a substitute) ! teaspoon salt Put the ginger, garlic, and 4 tablespoons water into the container of a food processor or blender. Blend until you have a paste. Quarter the courgettes, lengthwise, and then cut the strips into 1t inch (4cm) lengths. Heat the oil in a large frying pan over a medium flame. Put in the chipolatas. Fry, turning the chipolatas whenever necessary, until they have browned on all sides. Remove and keep in a plate. Put the onions into the same oil. Stir and fry until they begin to turn brown at the edges. Add the ginger-garlic paste. Stir and fry for a minute. Put in the cumin and cayenne. Stir a few times and put in the tomatoes. Stir for a minute. Put in the courgettes and salt. Bring to a simmer, cover, turn heat to low and cook for IO minutes. Cut the chipolatas into 3 pieces each. Add them to the pan. Cover and cook for about 5 minutes or until the chipolatas have heated through. Pork chops with chickpeas Chhole wala gosht Normally, this hearty, stewtype dish is cooked with cubes of pork cut off from the shoulder. I have substituted the more easily available thin-cut pork chops and added some mushrooms for good measure. In India, we often ate this dish with what was pronounced as 'selice' and was, in reality, slices of white bread. (As a child, I had assumed that 'selice' was just another Indian word!) I now prefer slices from the crustier French loaf. Beside the bread, you need to serve nothing more than a simple vegetable, cooked in an Indian or English style. A simple salad would also do. MEAT 6r This is a perfect dish for a winter's day and is best served in individual bowls or soup plates. Dried chickpeas can be cooked in many ways. You can soak them overnight before cooking them or you can follow the method that I have used here which allows the entire dish to be made in the course of a single day. You may make these pork chops a day ahead of time and just reheat them. Serves 6: !lb (225g) dried chickpeas, picked over, rinsed, and drained 3 pints (1.75litres) plus 3 tablespoons water A 1! inch (4cm) cube of fresh ginger, peeled and coarsely chopped 5 cloves garlic, peeled 4 tablespoons vegetable oil 2 lb (9oog) thin-cut pork chops (sometimes called 'breakfast chops') 8 whole cardamom pods A 1 inch (2.5cm) stick of cinnamon 2 bay leaves 1 teasp00n whole cumin seeds 6 oz (175g) onions, peeled and coarsely chopped 1 tablespoon ground cumin seeds 1 tablespoon ground coriander seeds 1 teaspoon ground turn1.eric I I oz (3oog) tom a toes, peeled (see page 29) and chopped * lb (35og) potatoes, peeled and cut int0* inch (2cm) dice 1 tablespoon salt IO oz (275g) medium- sized mushrooms, halved 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper (use more or less as desired) 62 MEAT Put the chickpeas in a pot. Add 3 pints (1.75 litres) water and bring to a boil. Cover, turn heat to low and simmer 2 minutes. Turn off the heat and let the pot sit, covered, for I hour. Bring the chickpeas to a boil again. Cover, turn heat to low and simmer for It hours. Put the ginger, garlic, and 3 tablespoons water into the container of a food processor or blender. Blend until you have a paste. Heat the oil in a large, wide pot over a medium-high flame. When hot, put in as many pork chops as the pot will hold in a single layer. Brown them on both sides without attempting to cook them through. Remove the chops and put them on a plate. Put the cardamom, cinnamon, bay leaves, and whole cumin seeds into the hot oil. Immediately, turn the heat down to medium- low. Stir once and put in the onions. Stir and fry the onions for a minute, scraping the hardened pan juices as you do so. Now put in the ginger-garlic paste and stir once. Put in the ground cumin, coriander, and turmeric. Stir for a minute. Put in the tomatoes, potatoes, pork chops and any liquid that may have accumulated in the plate, salt, as well as the chickpeas and all their cooking liquid. Stir and bring to a boil. Cover, turn heat to low and simmer 45 minutes. Add the mushrooms and cayenne. Cover and simmer for I 5 minutes. N .B. The large whole spices in this dish should not be eaten. CHICKEN Since chicken is now mass produced - and fairly cheap, its status has been greatly reduced. This saddens me. I was brought up thinking of chicken as something special and have never managed to get over thinking so; besides, I like chicken. And there are such wonderful ways to cook it, from the simple 'Spicy baked chicken' to the elegant Makkhani murghi ('Chicken in a butter sauce') and the very impressive Murgh musallam ('Whole chicken baked in aluminium foil'). If you are on a diet, you can eat 'Tandoori chicken' which is cooked without fat and when you want to indulge yourself, you can dine on Shahjahanl murghi ('Mughlai chicken with almonds and raisins'). There are two things to remember when cooking Indian-style chicken dishes. The first is that we nearly always skin the chicken before we cook it. Skin has never been popular in India, perhaps because it gets so soft and flabby in stews. The second is that, for most of our dishes, we cut up the chicken into fairly small pieces. Legs, for example, are always separated into drumsticks and thighs. Breasts are cut into 4- 6 parts. Wings and backs are similarly cut up. When one of my recipes calls for chicken parts, you can either buy a whole 3- 3! lb (r.s- 1.75kg) chicken and cut it up yourself using a sharp knife and a cleaver or else you can buy chicken joints - the ones you prefer - and cut them up further, if necessary. I happen to have a family in which four members like dark meat and one only likes breast meat (unless it is a roast, when we all prefer breast meat). This does not make life easy. But I do have to keep everyone happy so I frequently resort to buying joints. I have a few egg recipes in this chapter as well. If you are looking for a new, spicier approach to eggs, try Ekoon·, scrambled eggs cooked with fresh green coriander and tomato or the pie-like Parsi omelette seasoned with cumin and green chillies. Indians also know how to convert plain, hard boiled eggs into the most delicious main courses by putting them into thick, creamy sauces or tart, vinegary ones. 64 CHICKEN Bombay-style chicken with red split lentils Murghi aur masoor dal This dish, in which chicken is combined with red lentils, is really like a hearty stew, just perfect for cold winter days. You could add vegetables to it as well, such as shelled peas or 1- inch ( 1 em) lengths of green beans. If you do this, put in the vegetables at about the same time as you put in the lemon juice. Traditionally, rice is served on the side but, if you like, you could have this dish with thickly cut slices of some dark, crusty bread. Serves 61: 9 oz (zsog) red split lentils, picked over, washed, and drained 3 oz (75g) onion, peeled and chopped !-I fresh, hot green chilli, finely sliced 2 teaspoons ground cumin seeds ! teaspoon ground turmeric 1 teaspoon very finely chopped, peeled ginger z! pints (1.5 litres) water About 3lb (I kg 35og) of jointed chicken parts, skinned zi teaspoons salt 2 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 teasp00n whole cumin seeds 2-4 cloves garlic, peeled and finely chopped ;(-~teaspoon cayenne pepper 2 tablespoons lemon juice ! teaspoon sugar ! teaspoon garam masala (see page I8) Optional garnish: 3 tablespoons chopped fresh coriander Combine the lentils, onion, green chilli, ground cumin, turmeric, half of the chopped ginger and 2t pints (1.5 litres) water in a big, heavy pot. Bring to a simmer, cover, leaving the lid very slightly ajar, and cook on low heat for 45 minutes. Add the chicken and the salt. Mix and bring to a boil. Cover, turn heat to low and simmer gently for 25- 30 minutes or until chicken is tender. H eat the oil in a small frying pan over a medium flame. When hot, put in the whole cumin seeds. As soon as the seeds begin to sizzle - this just takes a few seconds - put in the remaining 1- teaspoon chopped ginger and garlic. Fry until the garlic turns slightly brown. Now put in the cayenne pepper. Lift up the frying pan immediately and pour its entire contents - oil and spices - into the pot with the chicken and lentils. Also add the lemon juice, sugar, and garam masaLa. Stir to mix and cook on a medium-low flame for another 5 minutes. Sprinkle the fresh coriander over the top just before you serve. CH ICKEN 65 Tandoori-style chicken Tandoori murghi I have, I think, found a way to make tandoori-style chicken without a tandoor! The tandoor, as I am sure you all know by now, is a vat-shaped clay oven, heated with charcoal or wood. The heat inside builds up to such an extent that small whole chickens, skewered and thrust into it, cook in about 10 minutes. This fierce heat seals the juices of the bird and keeps it moist while an earlier marinating process ensures that the chicken is tender and well flavoured. The result is quite spectacular. To approximate a tandoor, I use an ordinary oven, pre-heated to its maximum temperature. Then, instead of cooking a whole bird, I use serving- sized pieces - legs that are cut into two and breasts that are quartered. The cooking time is not 10 minutes because home ovens do not get as hot as tan doors. Still, breasts cook in about 15- 20 minutes and legs in 20- 25 minutes. Tandoori chicken may, of course, be served just the way it comes out of the oven with a few wedges of lemon, or it can, without much effort, be transformed into Makkhani mw'ghi (see next recipe) by smothering it with a rich butter-cream-tomato sauce. Both dishes are excellent for dinner parties as most of the work can be done a day ahead of time. The chicken is marinated the night before so all you have to do on the day of the party is to cook it in the oven for a brief 20- 25 minutes just before you sit down to eat. If you wish to make the sauce, all the ingredients for it except the butter may be combined in a bowl the day before and refrigerated. After that, the sauce cooks in less than fi ve minutes and involves only one step - heating it. Both these chicken dishes may be served with rice or naan and a green bean or cauliflower dish.

Cut each leg into two pieces and each breast into four pieces. Cut two long slits on each side of each part of the legs. The slits should never start at an edge and they should be deep enough to reach the bone. Cut similar slits on the meaty side of each breast piece. Spread the chicken pieces out on one or two large platters. Sprinkle half the salt and squeeze the juice from three-quarters of a lemon over them. Lightly rub the salt and lemon juice into the slits. Turn the chicken pieces over and do the same on the other side vvith the remaining salt and lemon juice. Set aside for 20 minutes. Combine the yoghurt, onion, garlic, ginger, green chilli and garam masala in the container of an electric blender or food processor. Blend until you have a smooth paste. Empty the paste into a strainer set over a large ceramic or stainless steel bowl. Push the paste through. Brush the chicken pieces on both sides with the food colouring and then put them with any accumulated juices and any remain- ing food colouring into the bowl with the marinade. M ix well, making sure that the marinade goes into the slits in the chicken. Cover and refrigerate for 6- 24 hours (the longer the better). Preheat the oven to its maximum temperature. Take the chicken pieces out of the bowl, shaking off as much of the marinade as possible. Arrange them in a large shallow baking tray in a single layer. Bake for 2 0 - 25 minutes or until just done. You might test the chicken with a fork just to be sure. Serve hot, with lime wedges. N.B. The left over marinade may be frozen, and re-used once. CHICKEN 69 Chicken in a butter sauce Makkhani murghi The sa uce in this dish should be folded into butter at the very last minute as it tends to separate otherwise. However, you can combine all the ingredients except the butter up to a day ahead of time and refrigerate them until they are needed . This is a wonderfully simple but spectacular dish in which the Tandoori chicken of the preceding recipe is transformed \\<Vith a sa uce. Serves 4- 6: 4 tablespoons tomato puree Water to mix A 1 inch (z.scm) cube of fresh ginger, peeled and grated very finely to a pulp ! pint (275ml) single crean1. 1 teaspoon garam masala (page 18) f teaspoon salt ! teaspoon sugar I fresh, hot green chilli, finely chopped ! teaspoon cayenne pepper r tablespoon very finely chopped fresh green coriander 4 teaspoons lemon juice 1 teaspoon ground roasted cun1.in seeds (see page 17) 4 oz (uog) unsalted butter Tandoori-style chicken, freshly cooked according to the preceding recipe 70 CIII CKEN Put the tomato paste in a clear measuring jug. Add water slowl y, mixing as you go, to make up 8 fl oz (225ml) of tomato sauce. Add the ginger, cream,garam masala, salt, sugar, green chilli, cayenne, green coriander, lemon juice, and ground roasted cumin seeds. Mix well. Heat the butter in a wide saute pan or a large frying pan. When the butter has melted, add all the ingredients in the measuring jug. Bring to a simmer and cook on medium heat for a minute, mixing in the butter as you do so. Add the chicken pieces (but not their ac- cumulated juices). Stir once and put chicken pieces on a warm serving platter. Extra sauce should be spooned over the top. Spicy baked chicken Masaledar murghi Here is one of those easy chicken dishes that can be prepared almost effortlessly. There is a marinating period, though, of about 3 hours. This chicken has a very red look which it gets from ground, hot red chillies. To get the same effect - and not all of the heat - you can combine paprika with cayenne pepper in any proportion that you like as long as the total quantity is about It tablespoons. I like to serve this chicken with 'Rice with peas' (page 149) and 'Red split lentils' (page 122). Serves 6: 1 tablespoon ground cumin seeds 1 tablespoon paprika 1! teaspoons cayenne pepper (see note above) 1 tablespoon ground turmeric I- I! teaspoons freshly ground black pepper 2!-3 teaspoons salt- or to taste 2-3 cloves garlic, peeled and mashed to a pulp 6 tablespoons lemon juice 3! lb (1kg 500g) chicken pieces, skinned 3 tablespoons vegetable oil Combine the cumin, paprika, cayenne, tur- meric, black pepper, salt, garlic, and lemon juice in a bowl. Mix well. Rub this mixture over the chicken pieces, pushing the paste inside any flaps and openings that you can find. Stuff some paste along the bone of the drumsticks. Spread the chicken pieces in a shallow baking tray, skin side down, and set aside in a cool place for 3 hours. (Longer will not hurt. Just cover the chicken with cling film to prevent it from drying out.) Preheat the oven to gas mark 6, 400 F (zoo C). Brush the tops of the chicken pieces with the oil. Put the chicken in the oven and bake for 20 minutes. Turn the chicken pieces over and bake another 25 minutes or until chicken is tender. Baste the chicken pieces with the drippings 3- 4 times. If a lot of liquid accumulates in your baking tray, remove the extra fat with a spoon. Then pour the remaining liquid into a small pot. Boil down until the sauce is somewhat reduced. Arrange the chicken pieces on a platter, pour the reduced sauce over them and serve at once. CH ICKEN 71 Chicken in a fried onion sauce Murghi rasedar T his is how I cook the dish that my children refer to as our 'everyday' chicken. We tend to eat it with plain basmati rice and 'Carrot and onion salad' (page 171 ). Serves 4- 6: z! lb (1kg 125g) chicken joints 12 oz (350g) onions, peeled A 1! inch (4cm) cube of fresh ginger, peeled and coat·sely chopped 6 cloves garlic, peeled 7 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 tablespoon ground coriander seeds 1 tablespoon ground cumin seeds ! teaspoon ground turmeric !-! teaspoon cayenne pepper 4 tablespoons plain yoghurt 1 pint (570ml) water 8 oz (225g) tomatoes, peeled (see page 29) and very finely chopped (tinned toma toes may be substituted) 2 teaspoons salt ! teaspoon garam masala (page 18) 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh green coriander (parsley may be substituted ) 72 CHICKEN Cut the chicken into serving pieces. W hole legs should be separated into drumsticks and thighs. Whole breasts should be cut into 4- 6 pieces, depending on their size. Skin all the chicken pieces. Chop half of the onions coarsely. Cut the remaining onions into halves, lengthwise, and then crosswise into very thin slices. Put the chopped onions, ginger, and garlic into the container of a food processor or blender. Blend until you have a paste. H eat the oil in a large, wide pot or a large, deep frying pan (preferably non-stick) over a medium flame. When hot, put in the sliced onions. Stir and fry the onions until they are a deep, reddish-brown colour. Remove the onions with a slotted spoon, squeezing out and leaving behind as much of the oil as possible. Put the onions in a plate and set aside. T ake the pot off the flame. Put in the blended paste (keep face averted). Put the pot back on the heat. Stir and fry the paste until it is brown, about 3- 4 minutes. Now put in the coriander, cumin, turmeric and cayenne, stir once. Put in 1 tablespoon of the yoghurt. Stir for about 30 seconds or until it has been incorporated into the sauce. Add all the yoghurt this way, 0ne tablespoon at a time. Put in the chicken pieces and stir them around for a minute. Pour in the water, add the tomatoes and salt. Stir to mix and bring to a simmer. Cover, turn heat to low and cook for 20 minutes. Sprinkle in the garam masala and the fried onions. Mix. Cook, uncovered, on medium heat for 7- 8 minutes or until the sauce reduces and thickens. Skim off the fat and put the chicken in a warm serving dish. Sprinkle the green coriander over the top. Lemony chicken with fresh coriander Hare mas ale wali murghi Here is a delightful lemony, gingery dish that requires quite a lot of fresh coriander. It is a great favourite with our family. I generally serve it with 'Spiced basmati rice' (page 148). Serves 6: Two 1 inch (2.5cm) cubes of fresh ginger, peeled and coarsely chopped 4 tablespoons plus 5 f1 oz (Isoml) water 6 tablespoons vegetable oil 2! lb (I kg 175g) chicken parts, skinned 5 cloves garlic, peeled and very finely chopped 7 oz (2oog) fresh coriander (weight without roots and lower stems) very finely chopped !-I fresh, hot green chilli, very finely chopped i teaspoon cayenne pepper 2 teaspoons ground cum.in seeds 1 teaspoon ground coriander seeds t teaspoon ground turmeric 1 teaspoon salt- or to taste 2 tablespoons lemon juice Put the ginger and 4 tablespoons of the water into the container of an electric blender. Blend until you have a paste. Heat the oil in a wide, heavy, preferably non-stick pot over a medium-high flame. When hot, put in as many chicken pieces as the pot will hold in a single layer and brown on both sides. Remove the chicken pieces with a slotted spoon and put them in a bowl. Brown all the chicken pieces this way. Put the garlic into the same hot oil. As soon as the pieces turn a medium brown colour, turn heat to medium and pour in the paste from the blender. Stir and fry it for a minute. Now add the fresh coriander, green chilli, cayenne, ground cumin, ground coriander seeds, turmeric, and salt. Stir and cook for a minute. Put in all the chicken pieces as well as any liquid that might have accumulated in the chicken bowl. Also add 5 fl oz (r 5oml) water and the lemon juice. Stir and bring to a boil. Cover tightly, turn heat to low and cook for 15 minutes. Turn the chicken pieces over. Cover again and cook another ro- 15 minutes or until chicken is tender. If the sauce is too thin, uncover the pot and boil some of it away over a slightly higher heat. CHICKEN 73 Chicken with cream Malai wali murghi This rich, creamy dish may be served with 'Aubergine cooked in the pickling style' (page roo) and rice.

Mix well and set aside for at least one hour. Put the garlic and ginger into the container of an electric blender or food processor. Add 4 f1 oz (r2sml) of the water and blend until fairly smooth. Heat the oil in a wide, preferably non-stick pot over a medium-high flame. When hot, put in as many chicken pieces as the pot will hold easily in a single layer and brown lightly on both sides. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside in a bow I. Brown all the chicken pieces the same way. Put the chopped onion into the remaining oil. Stir and fry until the pieces turn a medium-brown colour. Add the garlic-ginger paste. Stir and fry until all the water from the paste evaporates and you see the oil again. Put in the remaining r teaspoon cumin, 1 teaspoon coriander, t teaspoon turmeric, and t teaspoon cayenne. Stir and fry for about 20 seconds. Now put in the chopped tomato. Turn the heat down to a medium-low. Stir and cook the spice paste for 3- 4 minutes, mashing the tomato pieces with the back of a slotted spoon as you do so. Add the yoghurt, a tablespoon at a time, incorporating it into the sauce each time before you add any more. Put in the chicken pieces and any accumulated juices, the remaining 7 fl oz (3ooml) water and 1 teaspoon salt. Bring to a boil. Cover, turn heat to low and simmer for 20 minutes. Take off the cover. Add the garam masala and cream. Mix gently. Turn the heat up to medium-high and cook, stirring gently now and then, until the sauce has reduced somewhat and turned fairly thick. Chicken with tomatoes and gar am mas ala Timatar murghi This simple chicken dish is a great favourite with our children.

Stir this mixture around until the onion picks up brown specks. Now put in the tomatoes, chicken, salt, and cayenne pepper. Stir to mix and bring to a boil. Cover tightly, turn heat to low and simmer for 25 minutes or until chicken is tender. Stir a few times during this cooking period . Remove cover and turn up heat to medium. Sprinkle in thegatam masala and cook, stirring gently for about 5 minutes in order to reduce the liquid somewhat. N.B. The whole spices in this dish should not be eaten. CHI CKEN 75 Mughlai chicken with almonds and raisins S hahjahani murghi This elegant, mild dish is very suitable for dinner parties. It could be accompanied by 'Spiced basmati rice' (page 148), 'Cauliflmver with potatoes' (page 109), and 'Yoghurt with walnuts and fresh coriander' (page 163). Serves 6: A 1 inch (2.5cm) cube of fresh ginger, peeled and coarsely chopped 8-9 cloves garlic, peeled 6 tablespoons blanched, slivered almonds 4 tablespoons of water 7 tablespoons vegetable oil 3 lb (1kg 350g) chicken pieces, skinned 1O whole cm·dam.om pods A 1 inch (2.5cm) stick of ctnnamon 2 bay leaves 5 whole cloves 7 oz (2oog) onions, peeled and finely chopped 2 teaspoons ground cumin seeds k-! teaspoon cayenne pepper 7 tablespoons plain yoghurt 1! teaspoons salt ~pint (275m I) single crcan1. 1-2 tablespoons sultanas ± teaspoon garam tnasala (page I8) 76 CHICKEN Put the ginger, garlic, 4 tablespoons of the almonds, and 4 tablespoons water into the container of an electric blender and blend until you have a paste. Heat the oil in a wide, preferably non-stick pot or deep frying pan over a medium-high flame. When hot, put in as many chicken pieces as the pot will hold in a single layer. Let the chicken pieces turn golden brown on the bottom . low turn all the pieces over and brown the second side. Remove the chicken pieces with a slotted spoon and put them in a bowl. Brown all the chicken pieces this way. Put the cardamom, cinnamon, bay leaves, and cloves into the same hot oil. Stir and fry them for a few seconds. Now put in the onions. Stir and fry the onions for 3- 4 minutes or unti l they are lightl y browned. Put in the paste from the blender, the cumin, and cayenne. Stir and fry for 2- 3 minutes or until the oil seems to separate from the spice mixture and the spices are lightl y browned. Add 1 tablespoon of the yoghurt. Stir and fry it for about 30 seconds. Now add an0ther tablespoon of yoghurt. Keep doing this until all the yoghurt has been incorporated. Put in the chicken pieces, any liquid that might ha ve accumulated in the chicken bowl, the cream, and salt. Bring to a simmer. Cover, turn heat to low and cook gently for 20 minutes. Add the sultanas and turn over the chicken pieces. Cover and cook another 10 minutes or until the chicken is tender. Add the garam masafa. Stir to mix. Put the remaining almonds in a baking tray and put them under the grill until they brown lightly. You will haYe to toss them frequently. Sprinkle these almonds over the chicken \\Yhen you serve. (Extra fat may be spooned off the top just before serving. The whole spices in the dish arc not meant to be eaten.) Goan-style chicken with roasted coconut Shakoothi I just love this dish. I ate it for the first time in balmy, palm-fringed, coastal Goa, and have been hoarding the recipe ever since. Even though there are seYeral steps to the recipe, it is not at all hard to put together, especially if you haYe grated coconut sitting around in the freezer, as I always haYc. I am now in the habit of buying two or three coconuts whenever I see any good ones. I grate them as soon as I get home (for instructions, sec page 15) and then store the grated flesh in flattened plastic packets. D efrosting takes no time at all. This way, I am always ready, not only to make shakoothi, but to sprinkle fresh coconut over meats and vegetables wheneYer I want to. You could serve this dish with plain long-grain rice, 'Spicy green beans' (page 103) and 'Onion relish' (page 174).

Chicken in a red sweet pepper sauce La! masale wali murghi Many of the meat, poultry, and fish dishes which are traditional along India's west coast have thick and stunningly red-looking sauces. T he main ingredient, which provides both the texture and the colour, are red chillies - either fresh, or dried. It is almost impossible to find the correct variety of red chilli in Britain - one that is bright red and just mildly hot. W hat I ha,·e discovered, though, is that a combination of red peppers and cayenne pepper works exceedingly \\Veil! I like to serve this dish with 'Aromatic yellow rice' (page T 53), and 'Yoghurt with aubergine' (page r64). Serves 4: 2{ lb (1kg) chicken parts (either drumsticks and thighs and/or breast} 4 oz (11og) onions, peeled and coarsely chopped A 1 inch (z.scm) cube of fresh ginger, peeled and coarsely chopped 3 cloves garlic, peeled 1 oz (zsg) blanched, sli vered almonds i lb (350g} red sweet- peppers trimmed, seeded, and coarsely chopped 1 tablespoon ground cumin seeds 2 teaspoons ground coriander seeds ! teaspoon ground tunneric ~-!teaspoo n cayenne pepper 2 teaspoon salt 7 tablespoons vegetable oil 8 f1 oz (zzsml) wa ter 2 tablespoons lemon juice ! teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper I f chicken legs are whole, di vide drumsticks from thighs with a sharp knife. Breasts should be cut into four parts. Skin all chicken pieces. Combine onions, ginger, garlic, almonds, peppers, cumin, coriander, turmeric, cayenne, and salt in the container of a food processor or blender. Blend, pushing down with a rubber spatula whenever you need to, until you have a paste. Put the oil in a large, wide, and preferably non-stick pan and heat it over a medium-high flame. When hot, pour in all the paste from the food processor or blender. Stir and fry the paste for ro- r 2 minutes or until you can see the oil form ing tiny bubbles around it. Put in th e chicken, with the 8 fl oz (225ml) water, lemon juice, and black pepper. Stir to mix and bring to a boil.

CIII CKEN 79 Whole chicken, baked in aluminium foil Murgh musallam Q,·er the years, as I am more and more rushed for time, I find myself simplifying some of my own recipes. The traditional murgh musallarn recipe, for example, is quite a complicated one. I now cook it relatively simply, by smothering a marinaded bird with a spice paste, wrappin g it in foil and popping it into the O\\'en. It \\YOrks bea utifully. I like to sen ·e this dish \"·ith ':\\lushroom pullao' (page I 52), 'Spinach cooked \\\\'i th onions' (page I I 5) and 'Yoghurt with cucumber and mint' (page r62). Serves 4- 6: For the nmrinade: A 1 inch (2.5cm) cube of fresh ginger, peeled and coarsely chopped 2 large cloves garlic, peeled 6 tablespoons plain yoghurt ! teaspoon ground turmeric 1! teaspoons salt ±-! teaspoon cayenne pepper Freshly ground black pepper So CHICKE Make the marinade: Put the ginger, garlic, and 3 tablespoons of the yoghurt into the container of a food processor or blender. Blend, pushing dovvn with a ru bber spatula whenever you need to, unti l you have a paste. Add the turmeric, salt, cayenne, and black pepper. Blend for a second to mi x. Empty the marinade into a bowl. (Do not wash out the food processor or blender yet. ) Add the remaining 3 tablespoons of the yoghurt to the marinade and beat it in with a fork. You also need: A whole, 311b (Ikg soog) chicken 8 oz (225g) onions 4 cloves garlic, peeled A 11 inch (4cm) cube of fresh ginger, peeled and coarsely chopped I oz (25g) blanched, slivered almonds 2 teaspoons gTound cumin seeds 2 teaspoons ground coriander seeds 1 teaspoon ground turn1eric 1 tablespoon ground paprika 1 teaspoon cayenne pepper I1 teaspoons salt 8 tablespoons vegetable oil 2 tablespoons len1.on juice 1 teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper 1 teaspoon garam masala (see page I8) Vegetable omelette Parsi om/ate Meanwhile, put the onions, garlic, ginger, and almonds into the food processor or blender. Blend, pushing down with a rubber spatula whenever you need to, until you have a paste. Add the cumin, coriander, turmeric, paprika, cayenne, and salt. Blend again to mix. H eat the oil in a large, non-stick pan over a medium-high flam e. Put in the paste from the food processor or blender. Fry, stirring, for 8- 9 minutes. Add the lemon juice, black pepper, and garammasa/a. M ix. Turn offthe heat and let the paste cool. Preheat oYen to gas mark 4, 350 F (180 C). W hen the chicken has finished sitting in its marinade for 2 hours, spread out a piece of aluminium foi l, large enough to enclose the chicken. Put the chicken, breast up, in the centre of the foil and put the giblets some- where near it. Rub the chicken, inside and out, as well as the giblets, with the fried spice paste. Bring the ends of the foil towards the centre to form a tight packet. All 'seams' should be 2 inches (scm) above the 'floor' of the packet. Put the wrapped chicken, breast up, on a baking tray and bake in a pre-heated oven for It hours or until tender. The Parsis who settled on India's west coast around the Bombay area, came originally from Persia over a thousand years ago. Even though they have proudly retained their religion, Zoroastrianism, they have been unafraid to let their adopted country or, for that matter, British colonialists, influence them in their choice of dress, language, and food. The Parsi culinary tradition is unique, borro·wing freely as it does from Gujeratis, Maharashtrians, and the English. But there is a Persian streak in there as well. T his can best be seen in the fondness for eggs and the abundance of egg dishes - eggs over fried okra, CH JCKEN 81 eggs over matchstick potatoes, eggs over tomato chutney - the list is long. Parsis also make all kinds of omelettes. Some are folded in the traditional way but many others are round and pie-like. The recipe here is for a pie-like omelette, filled vvith vegetables. This omelette has become one of my favourite brunch dishes now. It may be served, Western-style, with a salad, French bread and white wine, or it may be served Indian-style, with a stack of parathas or toast, 'Tomato, onion and green coriander relish' (page 172), and steaming hot tea. To make this omelette properly, it really helps to have a non-stick frying pan. The one I use measures 7t inches (1gcm) across at the bottom, curving up to 10 inches (25cm) across at the top. It is 2 inches (scm) in height. Your pan may ha ve a somewhat different shape. It does not reall y matter. Just remember that the pie-shaped omelette rises slightl y as it is cooking so a little space has to be left at the top. You also need a lid . If your frying pan does not have one, use aluminium foil. Serves 4- 6: 1 lb (45og) courgettes I ~ teaspoons salt - or to taste 5 tablespoons vegetable oil 4 oz (uog) onions, peeled and finely chopped 5 oz (I5og) potatoes, peeled and cut into ! inch (5mm) dice I-3 fresh, hot green chillies, finel y chopped 7 oz (zoog) tomatoes, chopped 14 teaspoons ground cumin seeds !-!teaspoon cayenne pepper, optional Freshly ground black pepper 9 large eggs 3 tablespoons finely chopped fresh green coriander (use parsley as a substitute) l teaspoon baking soda 82 CHI CKEN Trim and discard the ends of the courgettes and then grate them coarsely. Put the grated courgettes in a bowl. Sprinkle f teaspoon salt over them and mix thoroughly. Set aside for 30 minutes. Squeeze all the liquid out of the grated co UJ·gettes and then separate the strands so they are no longer bunched up. Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a non-stick frying pan (see note at the top of the recipe) over a medium flame. When hot, put in the onions. Stir and fry for a minute. Now put in the potatoes and the green chillies. Stir and fry for about 5 minutes or until the potato pieces are just about tender. Add the courgettes, tomatoes, cumin, the remaining 1 teaspoon salt, cayenne, and a generous amount of black pepper. Stir and cook for 2- 3 minutes or until the tomato pieces are soft. Set aside to cool. Break the eggs into a bowl and beat well. Empty the cooled vegetable mixture into the beaten eggs and add the fresh green coriander. Stir to mix. Sprinkle in the baking soda, maki ng sure that it is lump-free. Mix again. Wipe out the frying pan with a piece of kitchen paper. Pour in the remaining 2 tablespoons of oil and set to heat on a low flame. When hot, pour in the egg mi xture. Cover and cook on low heat for I 5 minutes. Remove the cover. Now you have to turn the omelette over. Do it this way: Invert a large plate over the frying pan. Place one hand on the plate. Quickly and deftl y, lift the frying pan up with the other hand and turn it upside down over the plate. Your omelette will now be in the plate with its browned side on top. Slip it back into the frying pan and cook it, uncovered, for 5 minutes. Invert the omelette once again on to a serving platter. The lighter side should now be on the top. Serve hot, warm, or at room temperature. Spicy scrambled eggs Ekoori Ekoori is the Parsi name for them but scrambled eggs, cooked in a similar style, are eaten all over India. Eat them with toast or any Indian bread. Serves 4: 3 tablespoons unsalted butter or vegetable oil I small onion, peeled and finely chopped ! teaspoon peeled and very finely grated fresh gmger !-I fresh, hot green chilli, finely chopped 1 tablespoon very finely chopped fresh green coriander k teaspoon ground turm.eric ! teaspoon ground cumin seeds I small tomato, peeled (see page 29) and chopped 6 large eggs, lightly beaten Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste Melt the butter in a medium sized, preferably non-stick frying pan over medium heat. Put in the onion and saute until soft. Add the ginger, chilli, fresh green coriander, turmeric, cumin and tomato. Stir and cook for 3- 4 minutes or until tomatoes are soft. Put in the beaten eggs. Salt and pepper them lightl y. Stir the eggs gently until they form soft, thick curds. Cook the scrambled eggs to any consistency you like. CHI CKEN 83 Hard boiled eggs in a spicy cream sauce Malaidar unday This delicious egg dish can be put together rather quickly and is just perfect for brunches, light lunches, and suppers. You could serve toast on the side or, if you like, rice and a crisp salad. If you prefer to serve a more traditional Indian meal, then parathas or spiced basmati rice and 'Gujerati-style green beans' (page roz) would be suitable accompaniments. This recipe calls for a small amount of chicken stock. If you have some home-made stock handy, well and good. Otherwise, use stock made with a cube, but adjust your salt as cube stock can be salty. 3 tablespoons vegetable oil 2 oz (sog) onion, peeled and finely chopped A 1 inch (2.5cm) cube of fresh ginger, peeled and finely grated !-I fresh, hot green chilli, finely chopped ! pint (275ml) single crean1 1 tablespoon lemon juice 1 teaspoon ground, roasted cumin seeds (see page 17) k teaspoon cayenne pepper ! teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon garam masala (see page I8) 2 teaspoons tomato paste 1 pint (15oml) chicken stock 6-8 hard boiled eggs, peeled and cut crosswise into halves 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh green coriander or parsley, optional 84 CHICKEN Heat the oil over medium heat in a large, preferably non-stick frying pan. When hot, put in the onions. Stir and fry the onions for about 3 minutes or until the pieces are browned at the edges. Put in the ginger and chilli. Stir and fry for a minute. Now put in the cream, lemon juice, ground roasted cumin, cayenne, salt, garam masala, tomato paste, and chicken stock. Stir to mix thoroughly and bring to a simmer. Put all the egg halves into the sauce in a single layer, cut side up. Spoon the sauce over them. Cook over medium heat for about 5 minutes, spooning the sauce frequently over the eggs as you do so. By this time the sauce will have become fairly thick. Put the egg halves carefully in a serving dish, cut side up, and pour the sauce over them. Garnish with the fresh green coriander, sprinkling it lightly over the top. Vinegared eggs B aida vindaloo T his vinegary, hard-boiled egg dish is almost like a pickle and perfect for taking out on picnics. It is, like all Goan-style vindaloo dishes, tart, hot, garlicky and just very slightly sweet. I have lessened the tartness somewhat by cooking the eggs in a mixture of vinegar and water instead of just vinegar. Use the mildest vinegar that you can find . In this recipe, you may use anywhere from 6 to 8 eggs without having to alter any of the other ingredients. You could serve this dish with rice or an Indian bread. 'Cauliflower and potatoes' (page ro9) would make a nice accompaniment. 4 cloves garlic, peeled A 1 inch (2.5cm) cube of fresh ginger, peeled and very finely grated k-! teaspoon cayenne pepper 2 teaspoons paprika r! teaspoons ground cumin seeds ri teaspoons salt r! tablespoons brown sugar 2 tablespoons plus 4 fl oz (rsoml) mild white vmegar 3 tablespoons vegetable oil A 1 inch (2.5cm) stick of c1nnan1on ! lb (225g) onions, peeled and finely chopped 6 fl oz (qsml) water ! teaspoon garam m asala (page 18) 6-8 hard-boiled eggs, peeled and cut crosswise into halves Mash the garlic cloves to a pulp or put them through a garlic press. Combine the garlic, ginger, cayenne, paprika, cumin, salt, brown sugar and 2 tablespoons of vinegar in a cup or small bowl. M ix well. H eat the oil in a medium-sized frying pan over medium heat. When hot, put in the cinnamon stick. Let it sizzle for a few seconds. Now put in all the onions. Stir and fry for about 5 minutes or until the onions have softened. Put in the paste from the cup as well as the garam masala. Stir and fry for 2 minutes. Add the 4 f1 oz (r 5oml) vinegar as well as 6 fl oz (r 75ml) water. Stir to mix and bring to a simmer. Put all the egg halves into the frying pan in a single layer, cut side up and spoon the sauce over them. Cook on medium heat for about 5 minutes or until the sauce has thickened. Spoon the sauce frequently over the eggs as you do so. CH ICKEN 85 Hard boiled eggs cooked with potatoes Unday aur aloo This simple dish is quite a famil y fa vourite.

Needless to say, the types of fish available in Indian riYers, lakes, and seas arc different from the ones found in th e colder British \\\\·aters. What used to be one of the common seafood s, fresh uncooked prawns, seems to have disappeared entirely from markets in Britain. I am hard put to understand why, since they can be found al l over France, just a few miles a'vvay. What I ha\\·e done for this chapter is to work out Indian-style recipes for the fish that are commonly available in Britain. The prawns I ha\\·e used are the cooked, packed frozen ones that arc found in supermarkets, or freezer centres and fishmongers. Just look for the largest and best varieties that you can find . Indians eat a fair amount of breaded, fried fish. I have used plaice for this as it is similar to our pomfret, at least in general shape. Our mackerel has a plumper form but is very similar in taste. So I have used it for a west coast recipe that calls for a fresh coriander and lemon marinade. We have no cod, halibut or haddock in India but the textures of some of our ri ver fi sh are similar. I have used them in Indian-style recipes in which they arc cooked with tomatoes or yoghurt or ca uliflower. I have even included a recipe for mussels. This is a Goan recipe, one of the few in this book that uses fresh cocon ut. It is an exquisite dish that can be made either with cockles or mussels. I need hardly repeat that if you are buying fresh fish, make sure that it is fresh. T he gi lls should be bright red, the eyes clear, the skin shiny, and the body firm and ta ut. The fish should not have a pronounced fish y odour. 88 £'I SH Goan-style mussels Thisra Although eaten with rice in Goa, I love to serve these mussels all by themselves as a first course. Serves 6: 30-36 small to medium- sized mussels A 1 inch (2.5cm) cube of fresh ginger, peeled and coarsely chopped 8 cloves of g-arlic, peeled 12 f1 oz (350ml) water 4 tablespoons vegetable oil 6- 7 oz (qs-2oog) onions, peeled and chopped 1!-2 fresh, hot green chillies, sliced into fine rounds ! teaspoon ground turmeric 2 teaspoons ground cumin seeds Half of a fresh coconut, finely gra ted (page 15) ! teaspoon salt Wash and scrub the mussels we11, removing the beards that are often attached to them. Discard any shells that are open. Put the ginger and garlic into the container of an electric blender or food processor. Add 4 fl oz (noml) water and blend until fairl y smooth . H eat the oil in a large pot over a medium flam e. When hot, put in the onions and saute them until they turn translucent. ow put in the paste from the blender, green chi11ies, turmeric and cumin . Stir and fry for a minute. Add the coconut, salt and 8 fl oz (225m!) of water. Bring to a boil. (This much of the recipe may be made several hours ahead of time.) Add the mussels. Mix wel1 and bring to a boil. Cover tightl y. Lower heat slightly and let mussels steam for 6 - IO minutes or until they open up. Serve immediately. FISH 89 Prawns with courgettes Jhinga aur ghia We do not have courgettes in India but we do have a variety of similar squashes which are often cooked with prawns and other seafood. Here is one such combination. I prefer to use relatively small courgettes that weigh about ± lb ( uog) each. If you can only get larger ones, just cut them appropriately so that each piece is just a little larger than a prawn. I like to serve these prawns with 'Spiced basmati rice' (page r48) or 'Plain long grain rice' (page r46) and 'Red split lentils' (page r22). Serves 4: i lb (35og) courgettes (see note above) I£ teaspoons salt i lb (35og) peeled, good quality prawns, defrosted 5 tablespoons vegetable oil 6 cloves garlic, peeled and very finely chopped 3 oz (75g) finely chopped fresh coriander (weight without lower stems and roots) I fresh, hot green chilli, finely chopped -! teaspoon ground turn1eric I-!tcaspoonsground cumin seeds ! teaspoon cayenne 3 small tinned tomatoes, finely chopped, plus 4 f1 oz (125ml) of liquid in tin 1 teaspoon very finely gTated fresh ginger 1 tablespoon lemon juice 90 FISH Scrub the courgettes and trim them. Now cut them in 4 slices lengthwise. Cut each slice, lengthwise, into 4 long strips. Cut the strips into thirds, crosswise. Put the courgettes in a bowl. Sprinkle t teaspoon salt over the pieces. Toss to mix and set aside for 30- 40 minutes. Drain and pat dry. Put the prawns on kitchen paper and dry them off as well. Heat the oil in a wide pot or a frying pan over a medium-high flame. When hot, put in the chopped garlic. Stir and fry until the garlic pieces turn a medium brown colour. Put in the courgettes, coriander, green chilli, turmeric, cumin, cayenne, tomatoes and their liquid, ginger, lemon juice, and remaining r teaspoon salt. Stir to mix and bring to a simmer. Add the prawns and stir them in. Cover, turn heat to low and simmer for 3 minutes. Uncover, turn the heat to medium and boil away from the liquid, if there is any, so that you are left with a thick sauce. Prawns in a dark sauce Rasedar jhinga I like to serve these prawns with plain basmati rice, 'Cauliflower and potatoes' (page I09), and 'Tomato, onion, and green coriander relish' (page 172). Serves 4: 3 oz (75g) onion, peeled and coarsely chopped 5 cloves garlic, peeled A 1 inch (2.5cm) cube of fresh ginger, peeled and coarsely chopped 3 tablespoons plus! pint (275ml) water 4 tablespoons vegetable oil A 1 inch (2.5cm) stick of cinnan10n 6 whole cardamom pods 2 bay leaves 2 teaspoons ground cumin seeds 1 teaspoon ground coriander seeds 6 oz (175g) tomatoes, peeled (see page 29) and very fin ely chopped 5 tablespoons plain yoghurt ! teaspoon ground turmeric t-! teaspoon cayenne pepper About ! teaspoon salt ! lb (35og) peeled, good quality prawns, defrosted and patted dry t teaspoon garam masala (page I8) 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh coriander Put the onion, garlic, ginger, and 3 table- spoons water into the container of an electric blender and blend until you have a paste. Heat the oil in an 8--<) inch (20- 23cm) wide pot over a medium-high flame. When hot, put in the cinnamon, cardamom, and bay leaves. Stir for 3- 4 seconds. Now put in the paste from the blender. Stir and fry for about 5 minutes or until the paste turns a light brown colour. Add the ground cumin and coriander. Stir and fry for 30 seconds. Put in the tomatoes. Stir and keep frying until the paste has a nice reddish-brown look to it. Now put in 1 tablespoon of the yoghurt. Stir and fry for IO- I5 seconds or until the yoghurt is in- corporated into the sauce. Add all the yoghurt this way, 1 tablespoon at a time. Put in the turmeric and cayenne and stir for a minute. Now put in t pint (275ml) water, the salt, and the prawns. Stir to mix and bring to a boil over a medium-high flame. Stir and cook over this medium-high flame for about 5 minutes or until you have a good, thick sauce. Do not overcook the prawns. Sprinkle the garam masala over the top and mix. Serve garnished with fresh coriander. N.B. The large whole spices are not meant to be eaten. FISH 9I Halibut with cauliflower Macchi aur phool gobi All you need to serve with this dish is some rice and a relish. Serves 4-6: A 1 inch (2.5cm) thick halibut steak, weighing ab0ut2 lb (9oog) (2 smaller steaks of equal thickness will do) I-! teaspoons ground cumin seeds I-! teaspoons ground coriander seeds -! teaspoon ground turm.eric Ab0ut! teaspoon cayenne pepper I! teaspoons salt 4 oz (I 10g) onion, peeled and coarsely chopped Two 1 inch (2.5cm) cubes of fresh ginger, peeled and coarsely chopped 1-2 fresh hot green chillies, roughly cut into 3-4 pieces each 3 tablespoons plus i pint (425ml) water 7 tablespoons vegetable oil i lb (350g) flowerets from a cauliflower head, each about2inches(scrn)in length and about 1 inch (2.5cm) across at the top 6 tablespoons plain yoghurt Freshly ground black pepper 92 FISH Have the fishmonger cut the halibut steak into pieces that are approximately 2 by It by 1 inches (5 by 4 by 2.5cm). Alternatively, you may do this yourself at home with a heavy cleaver that can hack through the bone. Leave the skin on. Put the fish pieces in a bowl. Sprinkle t teaspoon of the cumin, t teaspoon of the coriander, t teaspoon of the turmeric, t teaspoon of the cayenne, and t teaspoon of the salt over them. Toss to mix evenly. Set aside for t - I hour. Put the onion, ginger, green chillies, and 3 tablespoons water into the container of an electric blender. Blend until you have a paste. Heat 6 tablespoons of the oil in a 12 inch (3ocm), preferably non-stick, saute pan or deep frying pan over a medium flame. When hot, put in the cauliflower flowerets. Stir and fry them until they are very lightly browned. Remove with a slotted spoon and set aside in a bowl. Sprinkle t teaspoon salt and some black pepper over the cauliflower. Toss to mix. Put the fish pieces into the same pan in a single layer and brown lightly on both sides. Do not let the fish cook through. Remove the fish pieces carefully and keep them in a plate. Add an0ther tablespoon of oil to the pan and heat on a medium-high flame. When hot, put in the paste from the blender. Stir and fry the paste until it turns a light brown colour. Now add the remaining 1 teaspoon cumin, 1 teaspoon coriander, t-t teaspoon cayenne, and f teaspoon salt. Stir and fry for a minute. Put in 1 tablespoon of the yoghurt. Stir and fry it for about 30 seconds or until it is in- corporated into the paste. Add all the yoghurt Fried plaice fillets Tali hui macchi this way, 1 tablespoon at a time. Now pour in i pint (425ml) water, stir and bring to a simmer. Simmer on medium heat for 2 minutes. Gently put in the fish pieces and the cauliflower. Cover partially and cook on medium heat for about 5 minutes or until the fish is cooked through and the cauliflower is tender. Spoon the sauce over the fish and vegetables several times during this period. This is one of the simpler fish dishes served in many parts oflndia, with each area using its own local fish. The breading is, of course, a Western influence. Wedges oflemon or some tomato ketchup may be served on the side. Serves 4: 1! lb (7oog) plaice fillets with dark skin removed i teaspoon salt Freshly ground black pepper I! teaspoons ground cumin seeds ! teaspoon ground turmeric !teaspoon cayenne pepper 2 tablespoons very finely chopped fresh green coriander (use parsley as a substitute) zlarge eggs 6 oz (qsg) fresh bread crumbs Vegetable oil for shallow frying (enough to have! inch (Icm) in frying pan) Cut the fish fillet crosswise and at a slight diagonal, into i inch (2cm) wide strips. Lay the strips on a plate and sprinkle them on both sides with the salt, pepper, cumin, turmeric, cayenne, and fresh coriander. Pat down the spices so they adhere to the fish. Set aside for IS minutes. Break the eggs into a deep plate. Add 4 teaspoons water and beat lightly. Spread the breadcrumbs out in a second plate. Dip the fish pieces first in the egg and then in the crumbs to coat evenly. Put about f inch (Icm) of oil in a large frying pan and heat over a medium flame. When hot, put in as many pieces of fish as the pan will hold easily. Fry for 2- 3 minutes on each side or until golden brown. Drain on kitchen paper. Fry all the fish strips this way and serve hot. FISH 93 Haddock baked in a yoghurt sauce Dahi wali mace hi This is one of my favourite fish dishes - and it is so easy to put together. All you have to do is combine the ingredients in a baking dish and bake for about 30 minutes. You do have to boil down the sauce later but that takes just an additional 5 minutes. I like to serve this dish with 'Mushroom pullao' (page r52) and 'Spinach with potatoes' (page rr6). If you cannot get haddock, use any other, thick-cut fish such as cod or halibut. Serves 4-6: 6 oz (175g) onions, peeled 2lb (Ikg approx) 1 inch (2.5cm) thick fresh haddock fillets IS fl oz (425ml) plain yoghurt 2 tablespoons lemon juice 1 teaspoon sugar I! teaspoons salt ±teaspoon coarsely ground black pepper 2 teaspoons ground cumin seeds 2 tablespoons ground coriander seeds ±teaspoon garam masala (page I8) !-i teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 teaspoon peeled and finely grated fresh ginger 3 tablespoons vegetable oil I! oz (4og) unsalted cold butter, cut into pats 94 FISH Preheat oven to gas mark 5, 375 F (r9o\"C). Cut the onions into t inch (3mm) thick slices and line a large baking dish with them. (The dish should be large enough to hold the fish in a single Ia yer. It need not be more than r t inches (4cm) in depth.) Cut the fish fillets, crosswise, into 3 inch (7.5cm) long segments and lay them over the onions. Put the yoghurt into a bowl. Beat it lightly. Add the lemon juice, sugar, salt, black pepper, cumin, coriander, garam masala, cayenne, and ginger. Mix well. Add the oil and mix again. Pour this sauce over the fish, making sure that some of it goes under the pieces as well. Cover (with aluminium foil, if necessary) and bake in the upper third of the oven for 30 minutes or until the fish is just done. Carefully, pour out all the liquid from the baking dish into a small saucepan. (Keep the fish covered and in a warm place.) The sauce will look thin and 'separated'. Bring it to a boil. Boil rapidly until there are about r2 fl oz (35oml) of sauce left. Take the saucepan off the heat. Put in the pieces of butter and beat them in with a fork. As soon as the butter has melted, pour the sauce over the fish and serve. (You may also serve the dish cold, after it has been refrigerated overnight. This is not very traditional but we love it that way, with a green salad on the side.) Cod steaks in a spicy tomato sauce Timatar wali macchi !like to serve this with 'Rice with peas' (page I49) and 'Spinach cooked with onions' (page I I 5). Serves 4: 4 cod steaks, weighing about 2 lb (I kg approx.)

Rub them, on both sides, with ± teaspoon of the salt,± teaspoon of the cayenne, and± teaspoon turmeric. Set aside for 30 minutes. H eat 4 tablespoons of the oil in a saucepan over medium heat. W hen hot, put in the fennel and mustard seeds. As soon as the mustard seeds begin to pop (this just takes a few seconds), put in the onions and garlic. Stir and fry until the onions turn slightl y brown. ow put in the cumin, 1 teaspoon salt and i teaspoon cayenne. Stir once and put in the tomatoes and their liquid, the roasted cumin, and garam masala. Bring to a boil. Cover, turn heat to low, and simmer gently for IS minutes. Meanwhile, preheat the oven to gas mark -t,JSO F(r8o C). Put the remaining 5 tablespoons of oil in a large, preferably non-stick frying pan and heat over a medium-high fl ame. When hot, put in the fish steaks and brown on both sides. Do not cook the fish through. Put the steaks in a baking dish. Pour the cooked tomato sauce over the fish and bake, uncovered, for I 5 minutes or until the fish is done. FISH 95 Grilled mackerel with lemon and fresh coriander Hare masale wali macchi Indian mackerel seem to me to be much plumper than their English counterparts. Perhaps the warmer waters make them lazier. Goan fishermen on India's 'vvest coast roast them right on the beach over smouldering rice straws. The blackened skin is then peeled away and the now pristine, skinless fish served with a simple vinegar dressing. A good fresh mackerel needs nothing more. further up the same coast, in large cities like Bombay, the fish is marinaded first in a dressing of lemon juice and fresh green coriander and then fri ed or grilled. H ere is the Bombay recipe. I often serve it with ' 1ushroom pullao' (page 152) and 'Cabbage with peas' (page ro5). Serves 2: 2 medium-sized , whole mackerel, about I ~ lb (7oog) in all, cleaned 3 tablespoons very finel y chopped fi·esh green coriander ~- I fresh, hot green chilli, finely chopped 1 tablespoon lemon juice ~ teaspoon salt Ft·cshly ground black pepper 2 oz (sog) unsalted butter, cut into pats Cut the heads off the mackerel. Split them all the way down the stomach and then lay them out flat, skin side up, on a firm surface. Now bone the fish this way: Press down firml y with the heel of your hand all along the backbone. This should loosen the bone from the flesh somewhat. ow turn the fish over so the skin side is down. Work your fingers (or else use a knife) under the bones to prise them away from the fish. Cut two to three shallow diagonal slashes on the skin side of each fish. Combine the fresh coriander, chilli, lemon juice, salt and black pepper, in a bowl. Mix well. Rub this mixture all over the fish. Set aside for 4-5 minutes. H eat the grill. Put the fish in the grill pan, with the rack removed, skin side up, and dot with half the butter. Grill, 4 inches (rocm) away from the flame, for about 5 minutes. Turn the fish over, dot with the remaining butter and grill for 4 minutes or until golden brown . -vEGETABLES 97 I love all vegetables - from shiny purple aubergines that can be fried very simply with a light dusting of turmeric and cayenne to the humble potato which, in India, is cooked in at least a thousand different ways including one in which black pepper is the main seasoning. As many Indians are vegetarians, we have, over the years, worked out a great variety of ways to cook our everyday vegetables such as cabbages, green beans, beetroots and carrots. Sometimes the vegetables are cut into shreds or slices and quickly stir-fried with whole spices such as cumin and mustard seeds. These are referred to as 'dry' vegetables and rarely have even the glimmer of a sauce. At other times we may cook root vegetables in a thick ginger-garlic sauce or with tomatoes. Such dishes are referred to as 'wet' dishes because of the sauce. They are generally served in small, individual bowls. Both 'dry' and 'wet' dishes may be served with rice or Indian breads. For those of you who are vegetarians - or want to cut down on your meat intake - you can make perfectly balanced meals by picking two or three vegetables from this chapter and then adding a pulse dish, a rice or bread and a yoghurt relish. 98 VEGETABLES Fried aubergine slices Tala hua baigan This is one of the simplest ways of cooking aubergines in India. Ideally, the frying should be done at the very last minute and the melt-in-the-mouth slices served as soon as they come out of the hot oil. Sometimes I arrange these slices, like petals, around a roast leg of lamb. They can, of course, be served with any Indian meal. Left over aubergine slices, if there are any, may be heated together with any leftover, Indian-style meat the following day. The combination makes for a new dish and is very good. Serves 4-6: 1i lb (s6og) aubergine About 1 teaspoon salt ! teaspoon ground turmeric k-! teaspoon ground cayenne pepper Some freshly ground black pepper Vegetable oil for shallow frying 6-8 lemon wedges Cut the aubergine into quarters, lengthwise, and then cut, crosswise, into finch ( 1 em) thick wedges. Mix the salt, turmeric, cayenne, and black pepper in a small bowl. Sprinkle this com- bination over the aubergines and mix well. Heat about t inch ( 1 em) of oil in a 8- 9 inch (20- 23cm) frying pan over a medium flame. When hot, put in as many aubergine slices as the pan will hold in a single layer. Fry until reddish-gold on one side. Turn the slices and fry them on their second side. Remove with a slotted spoon and spread out on a plate lined with kitchen paper. Do a second batch, adding more oil, if you need to. Serve with lemon wedges. VEGETABLES 99 The Lake Palace Hotel's Aubergine cooked in the pickling style B aigan ac hari Right in the centre of a lake in the formerly royal city of U daipur is a summer palace, now converted, as most Indian palaces seem fated to be, into a spectacular hotel. This recipe comes from its master chef, Shankerlal, and in its finished effect is not unlike a spicy ratatouille. It is an exquisite dish. While Kalonji - black onion seeds - do give this dish its special 'pickled' taste, you may use whole cumin seeds instead. I love to eat this dish with a hearty lamb stew, such as Rogan josh ('Red lamb stew', page 51) and a bread (such asparathas). If you do not feel like an all-Indian meal, you could serve it with a leg of roast lamb and plain rice. I think it also tastes excellent cold. I often dole out individual portions on lettuce leaves and serve them as a first course. Sometimes I serve this dish for lunch with cold chicken, cold lamb, or sliced ham. Serves 6: A 1 inch (2.5cm) cube of fresh ginger, peeled and coarsely chopped 6 large cloves of garlic, peeled 2 fl oz (ssml) water 1~ lb (8oog) aubergines (large or small variety) 2 fl oz (ssml) water About I2 fl oz (35oml) vegetable oil 1 teasp00n whole fennel seeds ! teaspoon kalonji 0r whole cumin seeds ~ lb (35og) tomatoes, peeled (see page 29) and finely chopped 1 tablespoon ground coriander seeds ! teaspoon ground turmeric f teaspoon cayenne pepper (more, if you like) About 1! teaspoon salt IOO VEGETABLES Put the ginger and garlic into the container of an electric blender or food processor. Add 2 fl oz (ssml) of water and blend until fairly smooth. Cut the aubergine into slices or wedges that are -£- inch (2cm) thick and about If- 2 inches (4- scm) long. Set a sieve over a bowl. Heat 4 fl oz (125ml) of oil in a deep, 10- 12 inch (25- 30cm) frying pan or saucepan over a medium-high flame. When hot, put in as many aubergine slices as the pan will hold in a single layer. Let them turn a reddish-brown colour. Turn them over and brown the opposite sides. Remove the slices and put them in the sieve. Add another 4 fl oz (125ml) of oil to the frying pan and heat it. Brown a second batch of aubergine slices, just as you did the first. You will probably need to do three batches, adding fresh oil to the frying pan each time. (You may now turn off the heat under the frying pan and let the aubergine drain for about an hour or you may proceed im- mediately with the next step. The idea is to get rid of some of the oil that aubergines absorb so easily. You will achieve this end either way, though I do think it helps slightly to get rid of the oil at the earlier stage.) Put 3 tablespoons of oil in the frying pan and heat it over a medium flame. When hot, put in the fennel seeds and kalonji, 0r whole cumin. As soon as the fennel seeds turn a few shades darker (this takes just a few seconds), put in the chopped tomato, the ginger-garlic mixture, coriander, turmeric, cayenne and salt. Stir and cook for s- 6 minutes, breaking the tomato pieces with the back of a slotted spoon. Turn the heat up slightly and continue to stir and cook until the spice mixture gets thick and pastelike. Now put in the fried aubergine slices and mix gently. Cook on medium-low heat for about 5 minutes, stirring very gently as you do so. Cover the pan, turn heat to very low and cook another s- Io minutes if you think it is necessary. Oil will have collected at the bottom of the frying pan. Use a slotted spoon to lift the aubergine out of this oil when you serve. You could also serve this dish cold, almost as if it were a salad. In that case, store it with all its oil in the refrigerator. Take it out of the oil only when you serve. VEGETABLES IOI Gujerati-style green beans Gujerati sem H ere is a very simple, yet delicious way to cook green beans. T his dish goes well both with Indian meals and with grilled and roasted meats (I like it with sausages). Gujeratis often cook green vegetables with a little baking soda in order to preserve their bright colour. I am told that this kills the vitamins. So I blanch the beans and rinse them out quickly under cold running water instead. T his works equally well. I generally do the blanching and rinsing quite a bit ahead of time and do the fi nal cooking just before we sit down to eat. If you do not want the beans to be hot, either do without the red chilli or else discard all its seeds and use just the skin for flavour. Serves 4: 1 lb (450g) fresh green French beans 4 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 tablesp00n whole black mustard seeds 4 cloves garlic, peeled and very finely chopped r i hot, dried red chilli, coarsely crushed in a mortar 1 teaspoon salt ! teaspoon sugar Freshly ground black pepper I02 VEGETABLES Trim the beans and cut them into 1 inch (z.scm) lengths. Blanch the beans by drop- ping them into a pot of boiling water and boiling rapidly for 3- 4 minutes or until they are just tender. D rain immediately in a colander and rinse under cold, running water. Set aside. H eat the oil in a large frying pan over a medium flame. When hot, put in the mustard seeds. As soon as the mustard seeds begin to pop, put in the garlic. Stir the garlic pieces arounrl until they turn light brown. Put in the crushed red chilli and stir for a few seconds. Put in the green beans, salt, and sugar. Stir to mix. T urn the heat to medium-low. Stir and cook the beans for 7- 8 minutes or until they have absorbed the flavour of the spices. Add the black pepper, mix, and serve. Spicy green beans Masaledar sem These green beans may, of course, be served with an Indian dinner. But they could perk up a simple meal of roast chicken, pork chops or meat loaf as well. They are tart and hot and would complement the plainest of everyday foods with their zesty blend of flavours. Another good thing about them - they may be made ahead of time and reheated. Serves 6: 1! lb (7oog) fresh green French beans A piece of fresh ginger, abouti!inches(4cm)long and 1 inch (2.5cm) thick, peeled and coarsely chopped IO cloves of garlic, peeled I2 fl oz (350ml) water 5 tablespoons vegetable oil 2 teasp00ns whole cumin seeds I whole, dried hot red chilli, lightly crushed in a mortar 2 teaspoons ground coriander seeds ! lb (225g) tomatoes, peeled (see page 29 and finely chopped About I} teaspoons salt 3 tablespoons lemon juice -or to taste 1 teaspoon ground, roasted cumin seeds (see page 17) Freshly ground black pepper Trim the green beans and cut them, crosswise, at t inch (smm) intervals. Put the ginger and garlic into the container of an electric blender or food processor. Add 4 fl oz (125ml) of the measured water and blend until fairly smooth. Heat the oil in a wide, heavy saucepan over a medium flame. When hot, put in the cumin seeds. Five seconds later, put in the crushed chilli. As soon as it darkens, pour in the ginger-garlic paste. Stir and cook for about a minute. Put in the coriander. Stir a few times. Now put in the chopped tomatoes. Stir and cook for about 2 minutes, mashing up the tomato pieces with the back of a slotted spoon as you do so. Put in the beans, salt, and the remaining water. Bring to simmer. Cover, turn heat to low and cook for about 8- 10 minutes or until the beans are tender. Remove the cover. Add the lemon juice, roasted cumin, and a generous amount of freshly ground pepper. Turn heat up and boil away all of the liquid, stirring the beans gently as you do so. VEGETABLES 103 Beetroot with onions Shorvedar chukander I love beetroot, in almost any form. Even people who do not have a weakness for this particular root vegetable, manage to succumb to the charms of this recipe. It is a kind of stew, thickened by the onions floating around in it and somewhat tart in flavour because of the tomatoes it contains. As there is a fair amount of sauce, I frequently serve it with 'Beef baked with yoghurt and black pepper' (page so), a somewhat dry dish, and with 'Tomato, cucumber and green coriander relish' (page 172). Chapatis are the ideal bread to serve with this meal, though plain rice would also taste good. 1 lb (350g) raw beetroot (weight without stems and leaves) 4 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 teasp00n whole cumin seeds I clove garlic, peeled and very finely chopped 4 oz (uog) onion, peeled and coarsely chopped 1 teaspoon plain flflur !-!teaspoon cayenne pepper ! lb (225g) tomatoes, peeled (see page 29) and very finely chopped 1 teaspoon salt ! pint (275ml) water I 04 VEGETABLES Peel the beetroot and cut them into wedges. A medium-sized beetroot, about 2 inches (scm) in length, should, for example, be cut into 6 wedges. Heat the oil in a medium-sized pot over a medium flame. When hot, put in the cumin seeds. Let them sizzle for s seconds. Put in the garlic. Stir and fry until the garlic pieces turn golden. Put in the onion. Stir and fry for 2 minutes. Put in the flour and cayenne. Stir and fry for a minute. Now put in the beetroot, the tomatoes, salt, and ± pint (27sml) water. Bring to a simmer. Cover, turn heat to low and simmer 30 minutes or until beetroot are tender. Remove lid, turn up heat to medium, and cook uncovered for about 7 minutes or until the sauce has thickened slightly. This dish may be made ahead of time and reheated. Cabbage with peas Bund gobi aur matar Here is a simple cabbage dish that you could serve just as easily with grilled pork chops as with an Indian meal. Serves 4: 1-1* lb (5oog approx) green English cabbage 5 oz (I5og) frozen peas 5 tablespoons vegetable oil 2 teasp00ns whole cumin seeds 2 bay leaves * teaspoon ground turmeric ! teaspoon cayenne pepper I fresh hot green chilli, very finely chopped 4 teaspoon salt t teaspoon sugar * teaspoon garam masala (see page 18) Core the cabbage and cut it into very fine, long shreds. Put the peas in a strainer and hold them under warm, running water until they separate. Heat the oil in a wide pot over a medium- high flame. When hot, put in the cumin seeds and bay leaves. As soon as the bay leaves begin to take on colour - this just takes a few seconds - put in the cabbage and peas and stir them about for 30 seconds. Add the turmeric and cayenne. Stir to mix. Cover, turn heat to low and cook for 5 minutes or until vegetables are just tender. Add the green chilli, salt and sugar. Stir to mix. Cover and cook on low heat another 2- 3 minutes. Remove cover and sprinkle in the garam masala. Stir gently and mix. Remove bay leaves before serving. VEGETABLES 105 Gujerati-style cabbage with carrots Sambhara This is the kind of everyday vegetable dish that is served in many homes in the state ofGujerat. It cooks quickly and may be served as well with pork chops as with an Indian meal. Serves 4- 6: i lb (35og) green English cabbage i lb (35og) carrots !-• fresh, hot green chilli 4 tablespoons vegetable oil A pinch of ground asafetida (optional) 1 tablesp00n whole black mustard seeds I whole, hot dried red chilli About •! teaspoons salt ! teaspoon sugar 4 heaped tablespoons chopped fresh green coriander 1 tablespoon lemon juice I o6 VEGETABLES Core the cabbage and cut tt mto fine, long shreds. Peel the carrots and grate them coarsely. Cut the green chilli into thin, long strips. Heat the oil in a wide, casserole-type pot over a medium-high flame. When hot, put in the asafetida. A second later, put in the mustard seeds. As soon as the mustard seeds begin to pop (this takes just a few seconds), put in the dried red chilli. Stir once. The chilli should turn dark red in seconds. ow put in the cabbage, carrots and green chilli. Turn the heat down to medium and stir the vegetables around for half a minute. Add the salt, sugar and green coriander. Stir and cook for another 5 minutes or until vegetables are just done and retain some of their crispness. Add the lemon juice. Stir to mix. (Remove the whole red chilli before serving to those unfamiliar with Indian foods.) Carrots, peas, and potatoes, flavoured with cumin Gajar, matar, aur gobi ki bhaji Here is a simple, quick-cooking dish. Ideally, it should be made in an Indian karhai but if you do not have one, a large frying pan or saute pan will do. The vegetables are cooked in a Bengali style but could easily accompany a roast chicken or grilled sausages. Serves 6: 6 oz (175g) carrots 6 oz (I75g) potatoes that have been boiled, drained and cooled 6 oz (I75g) onions I spring onion 3 tablespoons mustard oil (another vegetable oil may be substituted) I! teasp00ns whole cumin seeds 2 whole, dried hot red chillies 6 oz (I75g) shelled peas About 1 teaspoon salt i teaspoon sugar Peel the carrot and cut it first into t inch (I em) thick diagonal slices and then into t inch (I em) dice. Peel the potato and cut it into t inch (I em) dice. Peel the onion and chop it coarsely. Cut the spring onion into very, very thin slices, all the way to the end of its green section. Heat the oil in a large frying pan over a medium flame. When hot, put in the cumin seeds. Let them sizzle for 3- 4 seconds. Now put in the whole chillies and stir them about for 3- 4 seconds. Put in the chopped onion. Stir and cook for 5 minutes or until onion pieces turn translucent. Put in the carrots and peas. Stir them about for a minute. Cover, turn heat to low, and cook for about 5 minutes or until vegetables are tender. Uncover and turn heat up slightly. Add the potatoes, salt, and sugar. Stir and cook another 2- 3 minutes. Add the spring onion. Stir and cook for 30 seconds. N .B. Remove the whole chillies before servmg. VEGETABLES I07 Cauliflower with onion and tomato Phool gobi ki bhaji good all-round vegetable dish that goes well with most Indian meat dishes.

Stir gently to mix. Add 3 tablespoons water, stir again and bring to a simmer. Cover and cook on gentle heat, stirring now and then, for s- ro minutes or until cauliflower is just done. Remove lid and sprinkle ga1'am masafa over the top. Stir to mix. Cauliflower with potatoes Phool gobi aur aloo ki bhaji T his is the kind of comforting 'homey' dish that most North Indians enjoy. It has no sauce and is generally eaten with a bread. I like to serve S hahi karma (page s6) or Tandoori chicken (page 66) with it. Serves 4- 6: ! lb (225g) potatoes I medium-sized cauliflower (you need 1 lb (-tsog) of flowerets) 5 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 teasp00n whole cumin seeds 1 teaspoon ground cumin seeds ! teaspoon ground coriander seeds t teaspoon ground turmeric t teaspoon cayenne pepper !-I fresh, hot green chilli, very finely chopped ! teaspoon ground roasted cumin seeds (see page 17) 1 teaspoon salt Freshly ground black pepper Boil the potatoes in their jackets and allow them to cool completely. (Day-old cooked potatoes that have been refrigerated work very well for this dish.) Peel the potatoes and cut them in to f inch (zcm) dice. Break up the ca uliflower into chunky fl owerets, about rt inches (4cm) across at the head and about rt inches (4cm) long. Soak the flowerets in a bowl of water for 30 minutes. Drain . H eat the oil in a large, preferably non-stick frying pan over a medium flam e. When hot, put in the whole cumin seeds. Let the seeds sizzle for 3- 4 seconds. ow put in the cauliflower and stir it about for 2 minutes. L et the cauliflower brown in spots. Cover, turn heat to low and simmer for about 4- 6 minutes or until cauliflower is almost done but still has a hint of crispness left. Put in the diced potatoes, ground cumin, coriander, turmeric, cayenne, green chilli, ground roasted cumin, salt, and some black pepper. Stir gently to mix. Continue to cook uncovered on low heat for another 3 minutes or until potatoes are heated through. Stir gently as you do so. Cauliflower with fennel and mustard seeds Baghari phool gobi You need about 2 medium-sized cauliflO\\vers for this dish or one large one. W hen the flowerets have all been cut, you should end up with about z lb of the vegetable. VEGETA BLES 109 You could serve this dish with 'Chicken in a red pepper sauce' (page 79) and rice. Serves 6: I large or 2 medium-sized cauliflowers (see note above) 7 tablespoons vegetable oil 2 teasp00ns whole fennel seeds 1 tablesp00n whole black mustard seeds r tablespoon very finely chopped garlic ! teaspoon ground turmeric !-1 teaspoon cayenne pepper About r! teaspoons salt 4 tablespoons water Cut the cauliflower into delicate flowerets that are no longer than 2 inches (scm), no wider at the head than an inch and about t inch (rem approx) thick. Put them into a bowl of water for at least half an hour. Drain them just before you get ready to cook. Heat the oil in a large, ro- 12 inch (25- 30cm) frying pan over a medium flame. When hot, put in the fennel and mustard seeds. As soon as the mustard seeds begin to pop, put in the finely chopped garlic. Stir and fry until the garlic pieces are lightly browned. Add the turmeric and cayenne. Stir once and quickly put in the cauliflower, salt, and about 4 tablespoons of water. Stir and cook on medium heat for 6- 7 minutes or until cauliflower is just done. It should retain its crispness and there should be no liquid left. If the water evaporates before the cauliflower is done, add a little more. (If your frying pan is smaller than the suggested size, the cauliflower will take longer to cook. In that case, it might be a good idea to cover it for 5 minutes.) Mushrooms and potatoes, cooked with garlic and gtnger Rasedar khumbi aloo This is one of those 'home-style' dishes that you rarely find in Indian restaurants. It is a thick, earthy stew that used to be made only when slim, monsoon mushrooms made a brief, seasonal appearance. Now, even in Indian cities you can buy cultivated white mushrooms all year round. Since these mushrooms come in a variety of sizes, you will have to use your own judgement about whether you should halve them, quarter them, or leave them whole. They should end up being about the same size as the diced potatoes. I I 0 VEGETABLES You could serve this with 'Beef baked with yoghurt and black pepper' (page so) and 'Gujerati carrot salad' (page I7o). Serves 4-6 9-IO oz (250-275g) potatoes I2 oz (350g) mushrooms A 1 inch (2.5cm) piece of fresh ginger, peeled 6 large cloves garlic, peeled 3 tablespoons plus 8 f1 oz (225ml) water 4 tablespoons vegetable oil About 1 teaspoon salt About t teaspoon ground turmeric 1 teasp00n whole cumin seeds 3 whole cardamom pods IO oz (275g) tomatoes, peeled (see page 29) and finely chopped 1 teaspoon ground cumin seeds ! teaspoon ground coriander seeds About l teaspoon cayenne pepper ± teaspoon garam masala (see page I8) Optional garnish: 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh coriander Boil the potatoes in their jackets. Drain and peel them. Cut them into 1 inch (z.scm) cubes. Wipe the mushrooms with a damp cloth. Cut off the lower, woody part of the stems. Now, depending upon their size, halve or quarter the mushrooms, or, if they are small, leave them whole. They should be about the size of the diced potatoes. Put the ginger and garlic into the container of a food processor or electric blender along with 3 tablespoons of water. Blend until you have a fine puree. Put the diced potatoes in a bowl. Sprinkle about i teaspoon salt and about t teaspoon turmeric over them. Toss to mix and set aside. Heat the oil in a heavy, wide, preferably non-stick pan over a medium flame. When hot, put in the potatoes. Stir and fry them until they are lightly browned on all sides. Remove potato pieces with a slotted spoon and set aside in a plate. Put whole cumin seeds and cardamom pods into the same pot. Stir them about for 3- 4 seconds. Now put in the tomatoes, the ginger-garlic paste, the ground cumin and the ground coriander. Stir and fry until the paste becomes thick and the oil separates from it. Add i teaspoon turmeric and the cayenne. Stir once or twice. Put in 8 fl oz water, the potatoes, mushrooms, and f teaspoon salt. Stir to mix and bring to a simmer. Cover, turn heat to low and simmer for 5 minutes. Remove the cover and turn heat up slightly. Cook, stirring gently, until you have a thick sauce. Sprinkle in the garam masala and stir to mix. Taste for salt. Serve garnished with fresh coriander. N.B. The whole cardamom pods are not meant to be eaten. VEGETABLES III Sweet and sour okra Kutchhi bhindi Here is an absolutely wonderful way to cook okra. It tastes best when made with young, tender pods. It may be served with 'Lamb with onions' (page 46) and 'Mushroom pullao' (page I 52). Serves 4-6: I4 oz (4oog) fresh, tender okra (bhindi) 7 medium-sized cloves of garlic, peeled I whole, dried hot red chilli (use half if you want it very mild) 7 tablespoons water 2 teaspoons ground cumin seeds 1 teaspoon ground coriander seeds ! teaspoon ground turmeric 4 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 teasp00n whole cumin seeds About 1 teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon sugar About 4 teaspoons lemon JUICe I I 2 VEGETABLES Rinse off the fresh okra and pat it dry. Trim the pods by cutting off the two ends. The top end is usually trimmed with a paring knife to leave a cone-shaped head . A tiny piece of the bottom is just snipped off. Cut the okra into -} inch (zcm) lengths. Put the garlic and chilli into the container of an electric blender with 3 tablespoons of the water. Blend until you have a smooth paste. Empty the paste into a small bowl. Add the ground cumin, coriander and turmeric. Mix. Heat the oil in a 9 inch (z3cm) frying pan or saute pan over a medium flame. When hot, put in the whole cumin seeds. As soon as the cumin seeds begin to sizzle (this happens within a few seconds), turn the heat down a bit and pour in the spice mixture sitting in the small bowl. Stir and fry for about a minute. Now put in the okra, salt, sugar, lemon juice, and 4 tablespoons of water. Stir to mix and bring to a gentle simmer. Cover tightly and cook on low heat for about IO minutes or until okra is tender. If your okra takes longer to cook, you might need to add just a little more water. Potatoes with black pepper Bengali aloo We take black pepper so much for granted, sprinkling tiny amounts on most foods without much thought. Apart from its taste, black pepper has a very enticing perfume and a delicate tartness as well. These properties are drawn out when the spice is used in generous quantities - as in the French steak au poivte or in these very Bengali potatoes. The dish is simplicity itself to make and may be eaten just as easily with European foods as with Indian. You could also stick toothpicks into the potato pieces and serve them with drinks. Serves 4: 1 lb 5 oz (6oog) potatoes 4 tablespoons vegetable oil About i teaspoon salt I-I! teaspoons freshly ground black pepper (a slightly coarse grind is best) 2 tablespoons very finely chopped fresh coriander or parsley, optional Boil the potatoes in their jackets and allow them to cool completely. (Day-old boiled potatoes that have been refrigerated work very well for this dish.) Peel the potatoes and cut them into f inch (zcm) dice. Heat the oil in a non-stick or very well seasoned frying pan over a medium flame. When hot, put in the potatoes and stir them around for a minute. Sprinkle in the salt and mix gently. Cover the potatoes and let them heat through on a medium-low flame for about 5 minutes. Stir them a few times during this period. Now add the black pepper and mix gently. Cook, uncovered, for another few minutes on a medium flame, stirring the potatoes every now and then and allowing them to brown slightly. Sprinkle in the fresh coriander, if you are using it. Mix and serve hot. VEGETABLES 113 Potatoes with sesame seeds Til ke aloo Here is another of those easy, delicious dishes that you might enjoy both with Indian meals and with simple dinners of roasted and grilled meats. Serves 6: 2lb (1kg) potatoes 6 tablespoons vegetable oil 2 teasp00ns whole cumin seeds 2 teasp00ns whole black mustard seeds 2 tablesp00ns whole sesame seeds About 2 teaspoons salt !-!teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 tablespoon lemon juice Boil the potatoes in their jackets. Drain and cool them for 3- 4 hours. Peel the potatoes and dice them into i inch (zcm) cubes. Heat the oil in a large, I o- I 2 inch (25- 30cm) frying pan over a medium flame. (A non-stick or well-seasoned cast-iron frying pan would be ideal.) When the oil is very hot, put in the cumin seeds, mustard seeds and sesame seeds. As soon as the seeds begin to pop (this just takes a few seconds), put in the diced potatoes. Stir and fry the potatoes for about 5 minutes. Add the salt, cayenne and lemon juice. Stir and fry for another 3- 4 minutes. I like the potatoes to have a few brown spots on them. 'Dry' potatoes with ginger and garlic Sookhe aloo Can you imagine cubes of potato encrusted with a spicy, crisply browned, ginger-garlic paste? Add to that a hint of fennel, if you want it. That is what these potatoes taste like. You could serve them with an Indian meal of Kheema matar ('Minced meat with peas', page 44), an Indian bread and a yoghurt relish, or you could serve them with grilled or roasted meats. It is best to make this dish in a large, non-stick frying pan or a well-used cast-iron one. I I 4 VEGETABLES Serves 4-5: 1 lb 6 oz (625g) potatoes A piece of fresh ginger, about 2 by I by 1 inches (5 by 2.5 by 2.5cm), peeled and coarsely chopped 3 cloves garlic, peeled 3 tablespoons water ! teaspoon ground turmeric 1 teaspoon salt ! teaspoon cayenne pepper 5 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 teasp00n whole fennel seeds (optional) Boil the potatoes in their jackets. Drain them and let them cool completely. Peel the potatoes and cut them into f-1 inch (2- 2.5cm) dice. Put the ginger, garlic, 3 tablespoons water, turmeric, salt, and cayenne into the container of a good processor or blender. Blend until you have a paste. Heat the oil in a large, preferably non-stick frying pan over a medium flame. When hot, put in the fennel seeds. Let them sizzle for a few seconds. Now put in the ginger-garlic paste. Stir and fry for 2 minutes. Put in the potatoes. Stir and fry for 51 minutes over a medium-high flame or until the potatoes have a nice, golden-brown crust on them. Spinach cooked with onions Mughlai saag I frequently serve this spinach with 'Chicken with cream' (page 74) and spiced basmati rice. Serves 4: 2lb (Ikg) spinach, washed and trimmed 4 oz (uog) onions, peeled 4 tablespoons ghee or vegetable oil !-I fresh, hot green chilli, finely chopped 1 teaspoon very finely grated, peeled fresh gmger About 1 teaspoon salt ! teaspoon sugar 4 fl oz (125ml) water l teaspoon garam masala (see page I8) Cut the spinach, crosswise, into t inch (Icm) wide strips. Chop the onion finely. Heat the ghee in a fairly large pot over a medium-high flame. When hot, put in the onions. Stir and fry for 3 minutes. Now put in the chopped spinach, green chilli, ginger, salt, and sugar. Stir and cook the spinach for 5 minutes. Add 4 fl oz (125ml) water and bring to a simmer. Cover tightly, turn heat to low, and cook for about 10 minutes. Uncover and boil away some of the extra liquid. Sprinkle garam masala over the top and mix. VEGETABLES 115 Frozen spinach with potatoes Saag aloo In India, we combine potatoes with almost every grain, meat, and vegetable. Here is one of my favourite recipes. It may be served with Rogan josh ('Red lamb or beef stew', page 5 I) and an Indian bread or rice. Serves 4- 6: 20 oz (ssog) (2 packets) frozen leaf spinach 1 pint (275ml) plus 2 tablespoons water 4 oz (I 10g) onions, peeled 5 tablespoons vegetable oil A pinch of ground asafetida (optional) 2 teasp00ns whole black mustard seeds 2 cloves garlic, peeled and finely chopped I8 oz (soog) potatoes, peeled and cut roughly into f-1 inch (2-2.5cm) cubes i teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 teaspoon salt I I 6 VEGETABLES Bring f pint (275ml) water to a boil in a saucepan. Put in the frozen spinach, cover, and cook the spinach until it is just done. Drain in a colander and rinse under cold water. Press out most of the liquid in the leaves (you do not have to be too thorough) and then chop them coarsely. Cut the onions into half, lengthwise, and then crosswise into very thin slices. Heat the oil in a heavy saucepan over a medium flame. When hot, put in the asafetida and then, a second later, the mustard seeds. As soon as the mustard seeds begin to pop (this just takes a few seconds), put in the onions and garlic. Stir and fry for 2 minutes. Put in the potatoes and cayenne. Stir and fry for a minutes. Now put in the spinach, salt, and 2 tablespoons water. Bring to a boil. Cover tightly, turn heat to very low and cook gently for 40 minutes or until the potatoes are tender. Stir a few times during the cooking period and make sure that there is always a little liquid in the pot. Stewed tomatoes S horvedar timatar It is best to make this dish in the summer, when tomatoes are plentiful. This is a 'wet' dish - it has a thinnish sauce - and should be served in individual bowls. You could eat it with 'Beef baked with yoghurt and black pepper' (page so), 'Spicy baked chicken' (page 7I) or 'Grilled mackerel with lemon and coriander' (page g6). Rice should be served on the side. Serves 4: 1! lb (7oog) tomatoes 3 tablespoons vegetable oil ! teasp00n whole cumin seeds 3 cloves garlic, peeled and very finely chopped 4 oz (uog) onion, peeled and chopped I-I! fresh hot green chillies 1 teaspoon very finely grated, peeled fresh gmger 1 teaspoon salt !-1 teaspoon sugar (preferably brown sugar) Drop the tomatoes into a pot of rapidly boiling water for IO- IS seconds. Drain, rinse under cold water and peel. Core the tomatoes and cut them into large chunks - roughly 1 inch (z.scm) cubes. Heat the oil in a medium-sized pot over a medium flame. When hot, put in the cumin seeds. A few seconds later, put in the garlic. Let the garlic pieces turn a medium-brown colour. ow put in the onion and green chillies. Stir and saute for about 2 minutes. Now put in the tomatoes, ginger, salt, and sugar. Bring to a boil. Cover, leaving the lid slightly ajar, turn heat to low, and simmer for about IO minutes or until tomatoes are just tender. VEGETABLES I I 7 Turnips with fresh coriander and mint Rasedar shaljum I have always had a fondness for turnips. The same, however, was not true for my three children, until I finally won them over with this dish. You could serve turnips with 'Lamb with onions' (page 46) and rice or an Indian bread. Serves 6: 2lb (Ikg) turnips (weight without leaves) 4 tablespoons vegetable oil I2 oz (375g) fresh tomatoes, peeled (see page 29) or tinned tomatoes may be substituted A 1 inch (2.5cm) cube of ginger, peeled and grated to a pulp 1 tablespoon ground coriander seeds ! teaspoon ground turmeric !-!teaspoon cayenne pepper i pint (425ml) water 3 tablespoons very finely chopped fresh coriander 2 tablespoons very finely chopped fresh mint I! teaspoons salt I I 8 VEGETABLES Peel the turnips and cut them in half, lengthwise. Put the cut ends flat against your chopping board and cut them, lengthwise, into t inch (1cm) thick slices. Heat the oil in a fairly wide pot over a medium-high flame. When hot, put in the tomatoes. Stir and fry for about 2 minutes. Add the ginger, coriander, turmeric, and cayenne. Stir and fry another 2 minutes or until the sauce is thick and paste like. Add the turnips, i pint (425ml) water, fresh coriander, mint, and salt. Cover, leaving the lid very slightly ajar, and cook on medium-low heat for 20 minutes. Stir a few times as the turnips cook. Now cover the pot tightly and cook on low heat another 10 minutes or until turnips are tender. You should have a little thick sauce left at the bottom of your pot which can be served spooned over the turnips. PULSES II9 Pulses - dried beans, split peas, and lentils - are a staple in India and help provide a large measure of the daily protein for families who eat meat rarely or are vegetarian. But beans, by themselves, are an incomplete food and need to be complemented - at the same meal - with a grain (rice or bread) and a dairy product (such as yoghurt or cheese). When nutritionists tell us today that this food combination has as much protein as a steak, I cannot help but think of the villagers in India whose basic diet, for centuries, has been dais (split peas) and rice or bread, washed down with a glass of buttermilk. Perhaps these villagers are not so badly off, after all! Apart from their food value, I find beans very versatile. Their non- asserti ve tastes and textures allow them to be used easily in soups. They also combine beautifully with meats and vegetables to make excellent main courses. Sometimes pulses can be hard to digest. The same Indian forbears who worked out that a nutritionally balanced vegetarian meal contained pulses, grains, and dairy products, also knew - I do not know how - that certain seasonings made beans more digestible. Today pulses in India are almost always cooked with at least one of the following: ginger, asafetida, and turmeric. We have man y different types of pulses in India. Some are left whole, others are split and sometimes skinned. It is the split peas that are called dais. The splitting helps to cook them much faster. All pulses need to be picked over and washed as the packets often include small stones and husks. Whole beans should either be soaked in water overnight before they are cooked or else they can be boiled in water for 2 minutes and then left to soak in the boiling water for an hour. The cooking time for all pulses varies according to their freshness. The fresher they are, the faster they cook. When cooking split peas, Indians always leave the lid slightly ajar. The reason for this is that split peas create a lot of thick froth as they cook and this blocks up the normal escape routes for the steam. So the pot boils over, creating a mess on the cooker. Leaving the lid slightly ajar helps to avoid this. All beans should be stored in tightly lidded containers. H ere is a description of the pulses I have used in this book: I20 PULSES Red split lentils Masoor dal Whole green lentils Moong dal Chana dal Black-eyed beans Lobhia Chickpeas Chhole These salmon-coloured, round, split lentils are available widely in most supermarkets. They turn pale yellow during cooking and have a pleasant, mild fla vour. These round, flying-saucer-shaped, greenish- brown lentils are very similar to our unsplit, unskinned masoor. They are available in all supermarkets and have the virtue of cooking quite fast. This is the skinned and split version of the same mung bean that is used to make bean sprouts for oriental cooking. The grains are pale yellow and somewhat elongated. This is, perhaps, the most popular North Indian da f. It has a mild, aristocratic flavour and is sold by Indian, Pakistani and Greek grocers, and increasingly by many supermarkets. This is very similar to the yellow split peas that are sold in supermarkets, only the grains are smaller and the flavour 'meatier' and sweeter. Chana dal is sold mainly by Indian and Pakistani grocers. Yellow split peas may be substituted for chana dal in my recipes. These excellent beans, greyish or beige ovals, graced with a dark dot, are sold widely in all supermarkets. They have a slightly smokey flavour. This large, heart-shaped, beige-coloured pea is sold by most supermarkets as well as South Asian, and Middle Eastern grocers. It lends itself to being cooked as a spicy snack food as well as being combined with meats and vegetables. PULSES I 2 I Red kidney beans Rajma Aduki beans Ma These large, dark-red, kidney-shaped beans are available in all supermarkets as well as Asian groceries. These smaller red beans look like the children of red kidney beans. For some reason, they are sold by their Japanese name, aduki, in most health food stores and supermarkets. Red split lentils with cumin seed Masoor dal This salmon coloured split pea turns dull yellow when cooked. It is sold as 'Egyptian lentils' in some Middle Eastern stores. It is best served with a rice dish and almost any Indian meat and vegetable you like. Serves 4-6: 7 oz (2oog) red split lentils (masoor dal), picked over, washed and drained Ii pints (I litre) water 2 thin slices ofunpeeled gmger ! teaspoon ground turmeric 1 teaspoon salt, or to taste 3 tablespoons ghee or vegetable oil A pinch of ground asafetida, optional 1 teasp00n whole cumin seeds 1 teaspoon ground coriander seeds ! teaspoon cayenne pepper 2 tablespoons finely chopped fresh coriander 122 PULSES Combine the lentils and rf pints (r litre) water in a heavy pot. Bring to a simmer. Remove any scum that collects at the top. Add the ginger and turmeric. Stir to mix. Cover, leaving the lid very slightly ajar, turn heat to low, and simmer gently for rt hours or until lentils are tender. Stir every 5 minutes during the last half hour to prevent sticking. Add the salt and stir to mix. Remove ginger slices. Heat the ghee in a small frying pan over a medium flame. When hot, put in the asafetida. A second later, put in the cumin seeds. Let the seeds sizzle for a few seconds. Now put in the ground coriander and cayenne. Stir once and then quickly pour the contents of the pan, ghee and spices, into the pot with the lentils. Stir to miX. Sprinkle the fresh coriander over the top when you serve. Red split lentils with cabbage Masoor dal aur band gobi I often eat this with rice and 'Lemony chicken with fresh coriander' (page 73). Serves 4-6: 7 oz (2oog) red split lentils, picked over, washed, and drained 2 pints (1.I5litres) water ! teaspoon ground turmeric 5 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 teasp00n whole cumin seeds 2-4 cloves garlic, peeled and finely chopped 3 oz (75g) onion, peeled and cut into fine slices ! lb (225g) cored and finely shredded cabbage 1-2 fresh hot green chillies, finely sliced I! teaspoons salt 4 oz (I 10g) tomato, peeled (see page 29) and finely chopped ! teaspoon peeled and finely grated fresh ginger Put the lentils and 2 pints (1.15 litres) water into a heavy pot and bring to a boil.

PULSES 125 Dry moong dal S ookhi moong dal Not all dais are cooked to be thin and soupy. Here the grains stand out, all plump and separate, and the dal has a fairly dry look. It is usually not eaten with rice but with breads and other meats and vegetables. I love to sprinkle some crisp, browned onions over the top, just before I serve it. You will find a recipe for the onions on page I74· Serves 4-6: 7 oz (2oog) moong dal 1 teaspoon ground coriander seeds 1 teaspoon ground cumin seeds t teaspoon ground turmeric l-i teaspoon cayenne pepper 1 tablespoon plus 8 fl oz (225ml) water 2 tablespoons vegetable oil Ab0ut! teaspoon salt 2 tablespoons ghee (see page 25) ! teasp00n whole cumin seeds I whole, hot dried red chilli, optional I26 PULSES Pick over the dal and wash it in several changes of water. Drain. Put the dal in a bowl. Pour about It pints (8soml) of water over it and let it soak for 3 hours. Drain. Combine the ground coriander, ground cumin, turmeric, and 1 tablespoon of water in a small cup. Heat the oil in a heavy pot over a medium flame. When it is hot, put in the spice mixture from the cup and stir once. Quickly put in the drained dal. Stir to mix. Add the salt and 8 f1 oz (225ml) of water. Bring to a boil. Cover tightly, turn heat to very low, and cook for IS minutes. The dal grains should now be quite tender. Just before you sit down to eat, put the hot dal into a serving bowl. Heat the ghee in a small pot or a small frying pan. When it is very hot, put in the whole cumin seeds. Let them sizzle for a few seconds. Now put in the whole chilli and stir it about for 2- 3 seconds - it should puff up and darken. Now pour the ghee and spices over the cooked dal. You may stir to mix or else leave the spices on the top as a kind of garnish. If you decide to use the fried onions, you may sprinkle these over the dal at the last minute as well. (Those unfamiliar with Indian foods should be warned that the whole chilli is very hot and not meant to be eaten - except by those who know what they are doing.) Small yellow split peas Chana dal Of all the dais, this one perhaps has the 'meatiest' taste. At its best, it also has a gentle sweetness. Chana daf is sold only by Indian grocers. If you cannot find it, substitute yellow split peas. You could serve this daf with rice, 'Chicken with tomatoes' (page 75) and 'Cauliflower and potatoes' (page 109). Serves 4-6: 8 oz (225g) chana dal or yellow split peas, picked over, washed, and drained 2 pints (1.I5litres) water ! teaspoon ground turmeric 2 thin slices of unpeeled gmger 1 1 teaspoon salt ! teaspoon garam masala (see page 18) 3 tablespoons ghee or vegetable oil (see page 25) ! teasp00n whole cumin seeds 1-2 cloves garlic, peeled and chopped !-! teaspoon red chilli powder Put the daf in a heavy pot along with 2 pints ( 1. 5 litres) water.

Sour chickpeas Khatte chhole Known variously as chickpeas, garbanzos, and in India, chholas and kabuli chanas, this unsplit, heart-shaped legume provides North Indians with some of their tastiest snack foods. As a child in Delhi, I much preferred buying my chholas from itinerant street Yendors. They were in variably sourer, spicier and much tastier than anything produced at home. (One of the reasons for my partiality to ' unclean bazaar food', as my father called it, may well have been that we were forbidden to eat it!) In this recipe, I have tried to reproduce that elusive 'bazaar' taste which made me an addict of the dish many years ago. Although Khalle chhole are generall y eaten as a snack in India, I serve them at my lunches and dinners, with vegetables, meats and rice.

PULSES 129 Red kidney beans Punjabi rajma Rajma, red kidney beans, are cooked slowly in Punjabi villages, often in the ashes of a tandoor or clay oven. I used to cook them for 4t hours on top of the stove but have now found a much quicker method. This dish may also be made with aduki beans or an equal mixture of red kidney beans and aduki beans. These beans may be served with Roganjosh ('Red lamb or beef stew', page 5 I) and an Indian bread.

Fast boil for IO minutes, then cover, leaving the lid very slightly ajar. Turn heat to low, and simmer gently for I hour. Discard the ginger slices. You may now mash the beans against the sides of the pot or take half the beans and their liquid and puree them in a blender. Pour this pureed paste back into the pot of beans. This gives the dish a pleasant texture. Add the salt, lemon juice, garam masala, and cream. Stir to mix and check seasonings. Heat the ghee in a small frying pan over a medium flame. When hot, put in the cumin seeds. Two seconds later, put in the finely chopped garlic and the remaining chopped ginger. Stir and fry until the garlic browns lightly. Put in the red chillies. Stir them once and then pour the contents of the pan, ghee and seasonings, into the pot with the beans. Stir to mix. N.B. The whole red chillies are not meant to be eaten. BREADS IJI T here are all kinds of breads in India, most of them unleavened, eaten in the North at every single meal. Many of these everyday breads are made with a very finely ground wholewheat flour that we call ala. I find that the British flour that approximates ala best is wheatmeal flour because it has just enough bran in it to give it body without making it too coarse for our soft, pliable breads. Of course, if you have access to Indian grocers and can buy ala (sometimes called chapati flour) do, by all means, use it. Some of our breads, such as the poori, are deep-fried. The ideal utensil for this is the Indian karhai because it is very economical on oil and because it prevents hot oil from splashing on to the cooker. A deep frying pan may be used as a substitute. Many other breads are cooked on a lava, a concave cast iron plate that is heated before breads such as chapatis and paralhas are slapped on to it. As I have suggested in the chapter on equipment, a cast-iron frying pan makes a perfectly adequate substitute. You will find one other kind ofbread in this chapter. It is really a savoury pancake and is made, not with flour but with a split pea (moong da!) batter. Such pancakes are a very common breakfast and snack food in India, specially in the West and South.

They are crispy-soft, delicious, and may be eaten with almost all Indian meats, vegetables, and pulses. They are also easy to make. Rolled out discs of dough are put into hot oil - the oil must be hot or the pooris will not 'blister' and puff- and they cook magically in just a few seconds. As pooris are best eaten hot, I have taught my entire family how to make them. I make three pooris per person. Then, if anyone wants more, they are told to go into the kitchen and make their own. And they do! Our poori dinners invariably turn into a 'happening' with flour-covered children and husband wandering in and out of the kitchen, rolling pin in hand and a look of great achievement on their faces. A word of caution: As the cooking oil for pooris is hot, care should be taken not to splash it around . An Indian karhai is the safest and most economical utensil for deep-frying. If you do not have one, use a deep frying pan. Do not drop the poori into the oil from a great height or it will splash. Bring your hand as close to the surface of the oil and lay the poori over it. Oil has no steam and will not burn you unless you touch it. When turning the poori over, bring it first to the edge of your utensil and then use the edge to help you turn it over. This, again, is to avoid splashes. Drain the cooked poori over the oil for a second or two before putting it in a platter. If you take these simple precautions (necessary for any deep-frying), poori-making can be fun . Makes 12 pooris and serves 4 4 oz (11og) sieved wheatmeal flour 4 oz (11og) plain flour ! teaspoon salt 2 tablespoons vegetable oil plus more for deep- frying 3! fl oz (10oml) water Put the two flours and salt in a bowl. Dribble the 2 tablespoons oil over the top. Rub the oil in with your fingers so the mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs. Slowly add the water to form a stiff ball of dough. Empty the ball on to a clean work surface. Knead it for IO- I2 minutes or until it is smooth. Form a ball. Rub about t teaspoon oil on the ball and slip it into a polythene bag. Set it aside for 30 minutes. Knead the dough again, and divide it into 12 equal balls. Keep I I of them covered while you work with the twelfth. Flatten this ball and roll it out into a s-st inch (IJ- I4cm) round. If you have the space, roll out all the pooris and keep them in a single layer, covered with cling film. Over a medium flame, set about 1 inch BREADS IJS Flat bread Chapati (z.scm) of oil to heat in a small, deep frying pan. Let it get very, very hot. Meanwhile, line a platter with kitchen paper. Lift up one poori and lay it carefully over the surface of the hot oil. It might sink to the bottom but it should rise in seconds and begin to sizzle. Using the back of a slotted spoon, push the poori gently into the oil with tiny, swiji strokes. Within seconds, the poori will puff up. Turn it over and cook the second side for about 10 seconds. Remove it with a slotted spoon and put it on the platter. Make all the pooris this way. The first layer on the platter may be covered with a layer of kitchen paper. More po01·is can then be spread over the top. Serve the pooris hot. Sometimes small and delicate and at other times large and thick, this is the basic, flat and disc-like, Indian bread eaten over most of north India. It is made out of a very finely ground whole-wheat flour that is sold in Indian shops as ala or 'chapati flour'. I find that finely sifted wheatmeal flour makes an adequate substitute. If you are using the wheatmeal flour, make sure you sift it before you weigh it. Some people like to add a little bit of salt to the flour. This should be done before you make the dough. Chapati dough has to be quite soft. The amount of water you use to form it will vary with the type of flour and the general humidity in the air. Use the quantity of water I have suggested as a guideline but don't be afraid to use more or less as you see fit. Because the dough is soft, chapatis are rolled out into their round, disc shape with the assistance of a fair amount of extra flour. Chapatis are traditionally cooked on a tava, a slightly concave, circular, cast iron plate, which is left to heat by itself before the first chapati is slapped on to it. This preheating prevents the chapati from becoming hard and brittle. If you don't have a tava, you could use a heavy, cast iron frying pan. First, the chapati is cooked briefl y on both sides. Then, in India at any rate, it is put directly on top oflive charcoal. It is this exposure to intense heat that makes it puff up. Since few of us have live charcoal in our kitchens any more, this same puffing-up process may be done by putting the chapati 136 BREADS directly on top of a low gas flame. The time a chapati spends sitting on the flame is very brief, and, for some reason, it does not burn or catch fire. You could, if you like, spread a little butter or ghee on top of the chapati as soon as it is made. Usually, chapatis are stacked, one on top of the other, as they are being made, and kept covered with a napkin, so they stay hot. eedless to say, they deflate in the process but still taste wonderful. The only way to eat a puffed-up chapati is to eat it as it comes off the cooker. Perfection in chapati-making does come with practice. If your first few chapatis turn out a little odd-shaped, remember that they 'vvill still taste good. Chapa tis freeze well and defrost easily, 'vvithout losing taste or texture. Makes about 15 9 oz (25og) sieved wheatmeal flour plus extra for dusting 6 f1 oz (qsml) water Put the 9 oz (25og) flour in a bowl. Slowly add about 6 fl oz (175ml) water, gathering the flour together as you do so, to form a soft dough. Knead the dough for 6- 8 minutes or until it is smooth. Put the dough in a bowl. Cover with a damp cloth and leave for half an hour. Set an Indian lava or any other cast iron frying pan to heat over a medium-low flame for IO minutes. When it is very hot, turn the heat to low. Knead the dough again and divide it, roughly, into IS parts. It will be fairly sticky, so rub your hands with a little flour when handling it. Take one part of the dough and form a ball. Flour your work surface generously and roll the ball in it. Press down on the ball to make a patty. Now roll this patty out, dusting it very frequently with flour, until it is about st inches (14cm) in diameter. Pick up this chapati and pat it between your hands to shake off extra flour and then slap it on to the hot lava or frying pan. Let it cook on low heat for about a minute. Its underside should develop white spots. Turn the chapatl over (I use my hands to do this but you could use a pair of tongs) and cook for about half a minute on the second side. Take the pan off the stove and put the chapatl directly on top of the low flame. It should puff up in seconds. Turn the chapati over and let the second side sit on the flame for a few seconds. Put the BREADS 137 Layered bread Paratha chapati in a deep plate lined with a large napkin . Fold the napkin over the chapati. Make all chapatis this way. Ideally, chapatis should be eaten as soon as they are made. But if you wish to eat them later, wrap the whole stack in aluminium foil and either refrigerate for a day or freeze. The chapatis may be reheated, still wrapped in foil, in a gas mark 7, 425°F (220°C) oven for I 5- 20 minutes. These are the triangular breads that we eat frequentl y with our meals and even pack up as school lunches for our children. With them, we have vegetables such as 'Spicy green beans' (page IOJ) or 'Aubergines cooked in the pickling style' (page 100) and meats such as 'Chicken with cream' (page 74).

Dribble 2 tablespoons of the oil over the top. Rub the oil in with your fingertips until the mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs. Slowly add about anywhere from 5 to 7 fl oz (I50- 2ooml) water and gather the flour together to form a softish ball. Empty the ball on to a clean work surface. Knead for about IO minutes or until you have a smooth, soft, but not sticky dough. Form a ball. Rub the ball with about t teaspoon oil and slip it into a polythene bag for 30 minutes or longer. Set a large, cast iron frying pan to heat on a medium-low flame. Meanwhile, knead the dough again and form I 2 equal balls. Keep I I of them covered while you work with the twelfth . Flatten this ball and dust it with some plain flour. Roll it out, into a 6 inch (Iscm) round, dusting your work surface with flour whenever necessary. Spread t teaspoon oil over the surface of the paratha and fold it in half. Spread about t teaspoon oil over the surface of the half that is on top and fold it into half again to form a triangle. Roll out this triangle into a larger triangle with 7 inch (18cm) sides. Dust with flour whenever necessary. Brush the hot frying pan with t teaspoon oil and slap the paratha on to it. Let the paratha cook for a minute. Now brush the top generously with 1 teaspoon oil. The brushing will take about 30 seconds. Turn the paratha over and cook the second side for a minute or so. Both sides should have reddish-gold spots. Move the paratha around as you cook so all ends are exposed evenly to the heat. Put the cooked paratha in a plate. Cover either with an inverted plate or with a piece of aluminium foil. Make all parathas this way. If parathas are not to be eaten right away, wrap them tightly in aluminium foil. The whole, wrapped bundle of parathas may then be heated in a gas mark 6, 400°F (zoo 0 C) oven for I 5- 20 minutes. Leavened oven bread Naan Naans and other similar flat leavened breads are eaten all the way from the Caucasus down through north-western India. In India, the baking is done in very hot clay ovens or Landoors. The breads are slapped on to the inside walls and cook quite happily alongside skewered chickens. At home, where most of us do not have tandoors, naans can be baked by using both the oven and the grill. Naans may be cooked both with and without egg. If you decide not to use the egg, just increase the yoghurt by about 4 tablespoons. Naans may be eaten with almost any Indian meat or vegetable. BREADS 139 Makes 6 large breads: i pint (1soml) hand-hot milk 2 teaspoons castor sugar 2 teaspoons dried active yeast 1 lb (45og) plain flour ! teaspoon salt 1 teaspoon baking powder 2 tablespoons vegetable oil plus a little extra 5 f1 oz (Isoml) plain yoghurt, lightly beaten I large egg, lightly beaten 140 BREADS Put the milk in a bowl. Add 1 teaspoon of the sugar and the yeast. Stir to mix. Set aside for I 5- 20 minutes or until the yeast has dissolved and the mixture is frothy. Sift the flour, salt, and baking powder into a large bowl. Add the remaining 1 teaspoon sugar, the yeast mixture, the 2 tablespoons vegetable oil, the yoghurt, and the egg. Mix and form a ball of dough. Empty the ball of dough on to a clean work surface and knead it for 10 minutes or more, until it is smooth and satiny. Form into a ball. Pour about t teaspoon oil into a large bowl and roll the ball of dough in it. Cover the bowl with a piece of cling film and set aside in a warm, draught-free place for 1 hour or until the dough has doubled in bulk. Preheat your oven to the highest temper- ature. Put the heaviest baking tray you own to heat in the oven. Preheat your grill. Punch down the dough and knead it again. Divide it into 6 equal balls. Keep five of them covered while you work with the sixth. Roll this ball into a tear-shaped naan, about r0 inches (25.5cm) in length and about 5 inches (r3cm) at its widest. Remove the hot baking tray from the oven and slap the naan on to it. Put it immediately into the oven for 3 minutes. It should puff up. Now place the baking tray and naan under the grill, about 3- 4 inches (7.5- IOcm) away from the heat, for about 30 seconds or until the top of the naan browns slightly. Wrap the naan in a clean tea towel. Make all the naans this way and serve hot. Moong dal pancakes with peas Gujerati poore Savoury pancakes made out of split peas, or rice and split peas, provide much of India with a nourishing snack food. These protein-rich pancakes are also eaten by many vegetarian Indians at breakfast, usually accompanied by a chutney and a glass of fresh buttermilk. You could also serve them with tea. Makes about 9: 6! oz (I9og) moong dal, picked over, washed, and drained 2 oz (sog) shelled peas A 1 inch (2.5cm) cube of ginger, peeled and coarsely chopped 2-3 cloves garlic, peeled 1-2 fresh, hot green chillies, cut into 4 pieces each 1 teaspoon salt i teaspoon ground turmeric 3 fl oz (7sml) plus 1 tablespoon water 2 oz (sog) onion, peeled and minced 2 tablespoons finely chopped coriander ± teaspoon baking soda About 4 fl oz (12sml) vegetable oil Put the dal in a bowl. Add If pints (1 litre) water and soak for 5 hours. Drain. Drop the peas into boiling water for 3- 4 minutes or until they are tender. Drain and chop coarsely. Combine the ginger, garlic, chillies, salt, turmeric, da/, and 3 f1 OZ ( 7 5ml) plus 1 tablespoon water in the container of an electric blender. Blend until you have a smooth batter. Let the machine run for 2- 3 minutes more so the batter gets light and airy. Empty the batter into a bowl. Add the onion and fresh coriander and peas. Mix. The batter may now be covered and refrigerated, if you like, for up to 24 hours. Just before you get ready to cook, add the baking soda and mix it in . Remember to stir the batter before you make each pancake. Brush an 8 inch (2ocm) non-stick frying pan with about 1 teaspoon of oil and set it to heat over a medium-low flame. Remove about 2 fl oz (ssml) of batter. When the oil is hot, drop this batter right in the centre of the pan. Now, place the rounded bottom of a soup spoon on the centre of the blob of batter. Using a gentle but continuous spiral motion, spread the batter outwards with the back of the spoon, smoothing out any ridges along the way. Make a pancake that is about st- 6 inches ( 14- 1 scm) in diameter. Dribble a teaspoon of oil over the pancake and another t teaspoon around its edges. Cover the pan and let the pancake cook for 2 minutes or until its underside turns a reddish colour. Uncover the BREADS 141 I42 BREADS pan and turn the pancake over. Cook the pancake on the second side for If minutes or until it develops small red spots. Remove the pancake and put it on a plate. Cover with a second plate, inverted over the first. Make all the pancakes this way, making sure you stir the batter each time. These pancakes are best eaten hot, just as soon as they are made. You could, if you wish, stack them on a sheet of aluminium foil and then wrap them into a bundle. The whole bundle can be heated in an oven at gas mark 7, 425°F (zzo 0 C) for I 5 minutes. RICE 143 M y English friends are always telling me that they cannot cook rice. They can hardly be blamed for their phobia. It starts, I think, with inadequate - inaccurate, in fact - instructions on rice packages that invariably suggest using far more water than rice really requires. The rice ends up by being mushy and the people who are cooking it often think that it is their fault. It is not. There are, actually, many methods of cooking rice well. You will find several in the chapter that follows. Rice can be cooked like pasta, in a lot of boiling water until it is half done. Then it can be drained and 'dried off' in a slow oven. Rice can be cooked completely on top of the cooker with just the correct amount of water needed for absorption. Or you can start cooking rice on top of the cooker with just the amount of water needed for absorption and then finish it off in the oven. The method you choose depends upon the recipe and what you want the rice to do. If you are unsure about cooking rice, just follow my recipes carefully and you should not go wrong. There are a few things that are worth remembering when cooking rice: 1 Use a heavy pot with a very tight-fitting lid. If you have a tin-lined copper pot hanging decoratively in your kitchen, this is your chance to use it. An enamelled, cast-iron pot is also good for rice. I find that such pots generally have fairly loose-fitting lids. There is a very quick remedy for this. Just cover the pot tightly with a sheet of aluminium foil first and then with its own lid. You can also make good rice in heavy, stainless steel pots. Any time you are unsure about the fittin g of the lid, interpose a layer of aluminium foil between it and the pot. Be sure to crinkle the edges of the foil so that hardly any steam escapes. In many of my recipes, the rice ends up by cooking in steam. If too much of it escapes, the rice will not cook properly. 2 For best results, rice should be washed in several changes of water and then soaked for about 30 minutes before it is cooked. The washing gets rid of the starchy powder left over from the milling process. The soaking lets each grain absorb water so it sticks less to the next grain while it is cooking. 3 If you are cooking rice with just enough water or stock needed for absorption, what is the correct proportion of liquid to rice? I like to measure my rice in a clear measuring jug and I never use more than It parts liquid to I part rice. If I have soaked the rice, my ratio changes to I+ parts liquid to I part nee. 4 Sometimes I saute my rice before I add liquid to it. This also helps to keep the grains separate. When you saute rice, do it gently. Some type of rice grains, such as basmati, are very delicate, particularly after they have been soaked. If you saute too vigorously, the grains break up into small pieces. 5 Once I cover my rice pot with a lid, I like to cook it on a very, very low flame. If you cannot adjust your heat to this very, very low, then use an oven- I44 RI CE proof pot to begin with, cover it tightly as instructed, and pop it into a preheated gas mark 3, 325 F (170°C) oven for 25 minutes. 6 Resist any urge you may have to peep into a covered pot of rice before the cooking time is over. Precious steam will escape and the rice will cook unevenly. 7 If you have a thin layer of rice at the top of your pot that does not get cooked all the way through, while the rest of the rice does, then your lid is not tight enough. Use aluminium foil between the pot and the lid next time around. Meanwhile, salvage your present situation by gently covering the partially cooked rice at the top with some fully cooked rice from the bottom. Add a tablespoon or two of water to the pot, cover tightly, this time using the foil , and cook for another ro minutes over very low heat. 8 When removing cooked rice from the pot, use a large slotted spoon. Either scrape out the rice gently, layer by layer or else ease the spoon gently into the rice, lift out as much as you can, put it in a platter and then break up any lumps by pressing lightly with the back of the spoon. I have used two types of rice in this chapter, long grain (which could be labelled 'Patna' or 'American long-grain') and basmati. Basmati rice grows best in the foothills of the Himalaya Mountains, in both India and Pakistan. Actually, it too is a long grain rice, only the grains are slender, delicate, naturally perfumed, and somewhat more expensive! The best basmati rice is aged for a year before it is sold. This ageing increases its unusual, nutty aroma. While it is not necessary to pick over and wash packaged American rice (though washing will give it a better texture) basmati rice must be picked over, washed and soaked before cooking as it often contains small stones and other impurities. To pick it over, empty the rice onto one end of a large platter. Now work the rice from one side of the platter to the other, inspecting the grains carefully. Push any stones or other suspicious objects to one side. Washing the grains: put the picked rice in your largest bowl. ow fill the bowl with cold water and gently swirl the rice around in it. The water will become cloudy with starch. Carefully pour the water away, holding back the rice with your free hand . Repeat 5 or 6 times, or as long as it takes for the water to remain reasonably clear. Soaking: Fill up the bowl again, only this time leave the rice in the water for 20 minutes to half an hour. Now drain the rice in a sieve. It should sit in the sieve for at least 20 minutes to become fairly dry before you cook it. If you use this method of preparation, combined with any of the various cooking methods given in the recipes, you will find that you need dramatically less water than you may have come to expect. Also your rice will have light, separated grains and will taste delicious. The amazing thing about rice is that it can be cooked with almost any RICE 145 spice and combined with any vegetable, pulse, or meat. It is, perhaps, the world's most amenable grain. Plain, easy-to-cook, rice Saaday Chaaval This is the quickest way of cooking American-style, packaged, long-grain rice. It requires no washing and no soaking and may be served with any food . Serves 4-6 Long-grain rice measured to the I 5 fl oz (425ml) level in a glass measuring jug 1 teaspoon salt, optional ~ oz (wg) unsalted butter, optional Il pints (7ooml) water Plain long-grain rice Barhiya chaaval Combine the rice, water, salt and butter in a heavy pot and bring to a boil. Cover very tightly, turn heat to very, very low, and cook, undisturbed, for 25 minutes. Turn off the heat and let the pot rest, still covered and undisturbed, for another 5 minutes. This rice is slightly more elegant than the one in the preceding recipe mainly because it is washed and soaked before being cooked. These steps get rid of the starchy powder on the grains and help them to remain separate and unsplit. Serves 4-6: Enough long-grain rice to fill a glass m easuring jug to the IS fl oz (425ml) level 1 teaspoon salt 1 pint (570ml) water Put the rice in a bowl and wash in several changes of water. Drain. Leave to soak in 2 pints (1.25 litres) of water for 30 minutes. Drain thoroughly. Put the drained rice, salt and 1 pint (57oml) water in a heavy pot and bring to a boil. Cover with a very tight-fitting lid, turn heat to very, very low and cook for 25 minutes. Take the rice pot off the flame and let it rest, still covered and undisturbed, for another 10 minutes. South Indian-style light, fluffy rice Dakshini chaaval In South India, rice is generally parboiled in a large, round-bottomed, narrow-necked utensil, with lots of water. When it is almost cooked, a cloth is tied to the mouth of the utensil and all the extra water drained out. (This water is later fed to the cows!) The pot is tilted so it lies on its belly over very low heat. A few live coals are placed on top of it as well to dry out the rice grains. Here is how the same rice may be made in a modern kitchen: Serves 6: Long-grain rice measured to the IS £I oz (425ml) level in a glass measuring jug 5 pints (3 litres) water 1 tablespoon salt, optional x-2 oz (zs-sog) unsalted butter, optional Plain basmati rice Basmati chaaval Preheat oven to gas mark 2, 300°F (150°C). Wash the rice in several changes of water and leave it to drain. Fill a large pot with about 5 pints (3 litres) of water. Add the salt to it if you wish and bring to a rolling boil. Empty the rice into the boiling water in a steady stream, stirring as you do so. Let the water come to a boil again. Boil rapidly for 7 minutes. Drain the rice in a colander. Quickly put the rice in an oven- proof pot. Lay the butter over it, cover tightly and put the pot in the oven for 35 minutes or until rice is done. Mix gently before serving. I was brought up with this fine-grained rice. Now, as it has become quite expensive, it is only served at festive occasions and at parties. Serves 6: Basmati rice measured to the IS £I oz (425ml) level in a glass measuring jug 1 pint (570ml) water i teaspoon salt 1 oz (Iog) unsalted butter Pick over the rice and put it in a bowl. Wash in several changes of water. Drain. Pour 2 pints (1.25litres) offresh water over the rice and let it soak for half an hour. Drain thoroughly. Combine the rice, salt, butter and 1 pint (57oml) water in a heavy-bottomed pot. Bring to a boil. Cover with a tight-fitting lid, turn heat to very low and cook for 20 minutes. Lift the lid, mix gently but quickly with a fork and cover again. Cook for 5- 10 minutes or until tender. RICE 147 Spiced basmati rice Masaledar basmati This is one of the finest - and most delicate - basmati rice dishes. It may be served with an Indian meal or with English dishes such as roast lamb or grilled chicken. Basmati rice measured to the IS f1 oz (425ml) level in a glass measuring jug 3 tablespoons vegetable oil 2 oz (sog) onion, peeled and finely chopped ! a fresh, hot green chilli, finely chopped ! teaspoon very finely chopped garlic ! teaspoon garam masala (see page 18) 1 teaspoon salt (a bit more if the stock is unsalted) 1 pint (570ml) chicken stock Pick over the rice and put in a bowl. Wash in several changes of water. Drain. Pour 2 pints (r.25 litres) fresh water over the rice and let it soak for half an hour. Leave to drain in a sieve for 20 minutes. Heat the oil in a heavy-bottomed saucepan over a medium flame. When hot, put in the onion. Stir and fry until the onion bits have browned lightly. Add the rice, green chilli, garlic, garam masala and salt. Stir gently for 3- 4 minutes until all the grains are coated with oil. If the rice begins to stick to the bottom of the pan, turn the heat down slightly. Now pour in the stock and bring the rice to a boil. Cover with a very tight-fitting lid, turn heat to very, very low and cook for 25 minutes. If you prefer, you could put the pan in a preheated gas mark 3, 325°F (J7o 0 C) oven for 25 minutes. Simple buttery rice with onion Pyaz wali basmati chaaval This simple method of cooking rice makes it extremely versatile. You could serve it with Indian and English meals.

RICE I49 Rice with yellow split peas Khili hui khichri Khichri is of ancient origin. I have read descriptions of it written by travellers who came to India as long as a thousand years ago. Khichri probably predates even these early travellers. It consists, basically, of rice and pulses cooked together and is served in most Indian homes in one of two forms, the 'wet', porridge-like version and the 'dry', grainy version. The recipe here is for the 'dry' khichri which my mother always referred to as khili hui khichri or 'the khich,-i which has bloomed'. This has the consistency of well-prepared rice. You could serve it with 'Lamb stew' (page 4 7) and an onion relish. Serves 6: 2 oz (sog) yellow split peas, picked over, washed, and drained Long-grain rice measured to the I 5 fl oz (425ml) level in a glass measuring jug 3 tablespoons ghee (see page 25) or vegetable oil ! teasp00n whole cumin seeds ! teaspoon garam masala (see page I8) 1 teaspoon salt- or to taste 4 tablespoons finely chopped fresh coriander (fresh parsley may be substituted) 1 pint (570ml) chicken stock (water may be substituted) I 50 RICE Soak the split peas in f pint (425ml) water for 3 hours. Drain. Wash the rice in several changes of water and drain. Soak in 2 pints (1.25litres) water for I hour. Drain. Heat the ghee in a heavy pot over a medium flame. When hot, put in the cumin seeds. Stir them around for a few seconds. Now put in the drained split peas and rice. Stir and saute for 2- 3 minutes or until the grains are coated with the ghee. Add the garam masala, salt, and fresh coriander. Stir and saute for another minute or so. Add the chicken stock and bring to a boil. Cover tightly, turn heat to very, very low and cook for 25 minutes. Turn off the heat and let the pot sit, covered and undisturbed, for another IO minutes. Stir gently with a slotted spoon or fork before serving. Vegetable pullao S ab zz\" pullao Sometimes, when I want an all-vegetarian meal, I serve this pullao with 'Black-eyed beans with mushrooms' (page 128) and a yoghurt dish. It can, of course, be served with any meat. Serves 6: Long-grain rice measured to the I 5 fl oz (425ml) level in a glass measuring jug 4 oz (uog) potato, peeled ! medium-sized carrot, about I! oz (4og) in all, peeled I! oz (4og) fresh green beans 4 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 teasp00n whole cumin seeds 1! teaspoon salt ! teaspoon ground turmeric 1 teaspoon ground cumin seeds 1 teaspoon ground coriander seeds ! teaspoon cayenne pepper ! fresh hot green chilli, finely chopped 2 tablespoons very finely chopped fresh coriander ! teaspoon peeled and very finely grated fresh ginger I clove garlic, peeled and mashed to a pulp 1 pint (57oml) water Put the rice in a bowl and wash in several changes of water.

Trim the green beans and cut, crosswise, at t inch (5mm) intervals. Heat the oil in a heavy pot over a medium heat. When hot, put in the cumin seeds. Let them sizzle for 5- 6 seconds. ow put in the potato, carrot, and green beans. Stir and saute for a minute. Turn the heat to medium-low and add the drained rice, salt, turmeric, ground cumin, ground coriander, cayenne, green chilli, fresh coriander, ginger, and garlic. Stir and saute the rice for 2- 3 minutes. Add 1 pint (57oml) water and bring to a boil. Cover very tightly, turn heat to very, very low, and cook for 25 minutes. Turn off the heat and let the pot sit, covered and undisturbed, for another IO minutes. RICE I 5I Mushroom pullao Khumbi pullao My mother used to make this dish with morel mushrooms. If you have some growing in your local woods, do, by all means, use them. Just slice them in half, lengthwise. You could also use the darker field mushrooms. In that case you would need to slice the caps. I tend to make this dish very frequently and find myself using the more easily available cultivated mushrooms. It is still a superb dish and may be served with almost any meat dish in this book. You could also serve it with a roast leg oflamb or with lamb chops. Serves 6: Long-grain rice measured to the IS fl oz (425ml) level in a glass measuring jug 5 oz (Isog) mushrooms 2 oz (sog) onion, peeled 3 tablespoons vegetable oil I clove garlic, peeled and finely chopped ! teaspoon peeled and finely grated fresh ginger i teaspoon garam masala (see page I8) 1 teaspoon salt 1 pint (570ml) water 152 RI CE Wash the rice in several changes of water and drain. Put the rice in a bowl. Add 2 pints (1.25 litres) water and soak for half an hour. Drain. Wipe the mushrooms with a dampened cloth or kitchen paper. Cut the mushrooms, from the caps down to the stems, into t inch (3mm) thick slices. Cut the onion into half, lengthwise, and then crosswise into very thin slices. Heat the oil in a heavy pot over a medium flame. When hot, put in the onions and garlic. Stir and fry for about 2 minutes or until the onions begin to turn brown at the edges. Put in the mushrooms and stir for another 2 minutes. Now put in the rice, ginger, gar am masala, and salt. Turn heat to medium-low. Stir and saute the rice for 2 minutes. Pour in 1 pint (570ml) water and bring to a boil. Cover very tightly, turn heat to very, very low and cook for 25 minutes. Turn off the heat and let the pot sit, covered and undisturbed, for another 5 minutes. Aromatic yellow rice Peelay chaaval You may use either basmati rice or American long-grain rice for this recipe. The yellow colour, here, comes from ground turmeric. I like to serve it with 'Chicken in a red pepper sauce' (page 79) and 'Gujerati-style green beans' (page I02) just to get a wonderful contrast of bright colours. Serves 6: Long-grain or basmati rice measured to the I 5 fl oz (425ml) level in a glass measuring jug 1 pint (570ml) water If teaspoons salt t teaspoon ground turmeric 3-4 whole cloves A 1 inch (2.5cm) stick of ctnnamon 3 bay leaves 3 tablespoons unsalted butter, cut into small pats Put the rice in a bowl and wash in several changes of water.

Combine the drained rice, 1 pint (570ml) water, salt, turmeric, cloves, cinnamon, and bay leaves in a heavy pot and bring to a boil. Cover with a tight-fitting lid, turn heat to very, very low, and cook for 25 minutes. Let the pot rest, covered and undisturbed for IO minutes. Add the small pats of butter to the rice and mix them in gently with a fork. Remove the whole spices before serving. RICE I 53 Lamb and rice casserole Mughlai lamb biryani Biryanis are grand, festive casseroles in which partially cooked rice is layered over cooked meat. Orange saffron milk is dribbled over the top, thereby colouring some grains yellow while leaving others white, and the dish set to bake in a slow oven. As it cooks, the biryani gets quite perfumed with saffron. These days, with saffron being as expensive as it is, many people, even in India, use yellow food colouring as a substitute. You may also do so if you wish. Just use 1 teaspoon yellow liquid food colouring diluted with 1 teaspoon water instead of the saffron and warm milk. Soaking the rice in salted water for long periods, from 3 to 24 hours, is an ancient trick that Persians have used to get rice grains as white - and as separate from each other - as possible. These shining white grains then contrast even better with those tinted with saffron . A biryani is really a meal in itself and may be eaten with just a yoghurt dish, such as 'Yoghurt with aubergines' (page I64), and a relish, such as my 'Tomato, onion, and green coriander relish' (page I72). However, since biryanis are generally served at feasts and banquets, we tend to be somewhat lavish. At such occasions, it would not be at all amiss to serve the condiments suggested above as well as 'Chicken in a red pepper sauce' (page 79) and 'Cauliflower with onion and tomato' (page 108). I54 RICE Serves 6: Long-grain rice measured to the I 5 f1 oz (425ml) level in a glass measuring jug About 3 tablespoons salt 1 teaspoon saffron threads 2 tablespoons warm milk 3 medium-sized onions, peeled 4 cloves garlic, peeled A l inch (2cm) cube of fresh ginger, peeled and coarsely chopped 4 tablespoons blanched, slivered almonds 3 tablespoons plus 6-! pints (3.6 litres) water 13 tablespoons vegetable oil 3 tablespoons sultanas 1! lb (7oog) boned lamb meat from the shoulder, cut into 1 inch (2.5cm) cubes 8 f1 oz (225ml) plain yoghurt s-6 whole cloves ! teasp00n whole black peppercorns ! teasp00n whole cardamom seeds 1 teasp00n whole cumin seeds 1 teasp00n whole coriander seeds A 1 inch (2.5cm) stick of ctnnamon Aboutj of a nutmeg !teaspoon cayenne pepper I oz (25g) unsalted butter, cut into 8 pieces 3 hard boiled eggs, peeled and at room temperature Wash the rice in several changes of water. Drain it and put it in a large bowl. Add 31 pints (2 litres) water and 1 tablespoon salt. Mix and soak for 3 hours. Put the saffron threads in a small, heavy (preferably cast iron) frying pan set over a medium flame. Toss the threads about until they turn a few shades darker. Put the warm milk in a small cup. Crumble the saffron into the warm milk and let it soak for 3 hours. Cut two of the onions in half, lengthwise, and then cut the halves into fine half-rings. Set these aside. Chop the remaining onion very coarsely. Put this chopped onion, garlic, ginger, 2 tablespoons of the almonds, and 3 tablespoons water into the container of an electric blender. Blend until you have a paste. Heat 6 tablespoons of the oil in a 10-inch (2scm), preferably non-stick frying pan over a medium-high flame. When hot, put in the onion half-rings. Stir and fry them until they are brown and crisp. Remove them with a slotted spoon and spread them out on a plate lined with kitchen paper. Put the sultanas into the same oil. Remove them as soon as they turn plump - which happens immediately. Put the sultanas in another plate lined with absorbant paper. Put the remaining 2 tablespoons almonds into the oil. Stir and fry them until they are golden. Remove them with a slotted spoon and spread them out beside the sultanas. Set aside for use as the garnish. Now put the meat cubes, a few at a time, into the same hot oil and brown them on all sides. As each batch gets done, put it in a bowl. Add another 7 tablespoons oil to the frying pan and turn heat to medium . When hot, put in the onion-garlic-ginger-almond paste from the blender. Fry, stirring all the time, until the paste turns a medium brown colour. I fit sticks slightly to the bottom of the pan, sprinkle in a little water and keep stirring. Return the meat RICE ISS IS6 RICE and any accumulated juices to the pan. Add the yoghurt, a tablespoon at a time, stirring well between each addition. Now put in 1f teaspoon salt and f pint (Isoml) water. Mix and bring to a simmer. Cover, turn heat to low and simmer for 30 minutes. While the meat is cooking, put the cloves, peppercorns, cardamom seeds, cumin seeds, coriander seeds, cinnamon, and nutmeg into the container of a spice grinder or a clean coffee grinder. Grind finely. When the meat has cooked for 30 minutes, add all the spices from the spice grinder as well as the cayenne and mix well. Cover again and continue to cook on low heat for another 30 minutes. Remove cover, raise heat to medium, and cook, stirring all the time, until you have about 7 fl oz (zoom!) of thick sauce left at the bottom of the pan. Turn off the heat and spoon off as much grease as possible. The meat should be pretty well cooked by now. Spread out the meat and sauce in the bottom of a heavy casserole. Cover and keep warm. Preheat oven to gas mark 2, 300°F (I50°C). Bring 6 pints (3.5 litres) of water to a rolling boil in a large pot. Add 1t tablespoons salt to it. Drain the rice and rinse it off under running water. Slowly, scatter the rice into the boiling water. Bring to a boil again and boil rapidly for exactly 6 minutes. Then drain the nee. Work fast now. Put the rice on top of the meat, piling it up in the shape of a hill. Take a chcpstick or the handle of a long spoon and make a 1 inch (z.scm) wide hole going down like a well from the peak of the rice hill to its bottom. Dribble the saffron milk in streaks along the sides of the hill. Lay the pieces of butter on the sides of the hill and scatter 2 tablespoons of the browned onions over it as well. Cover first with aluminium foil, sealing Sweet yellow rice Meetha pullao the edges well, and then with a lid. Bake in the oven for I hour. Remove from the oven. If left in a warm place, this rice will stay hot for 30 minutes. Just before you get ready to serve, quarter the eggs, lengthwise. Mix the contents of the rice pot gently. Serve the rice on a warmed platter, garnished with the eggs, remaining browned onions, sultanas and almonds. This wonderful, shining rice may be eaten by itself, with hot, spicy Indian dishes or even with English foods such as baked ham and roast goose. Saffron does give this dish a very special flavour but if you are on a tight budget and find saffron a bit too expensive, just leave it (and the milk) out and increase the yellow food colouring to I teaspoon. Serves 4: ! teaspoon saffron threads 2 tablespoons warm milk Basmati rice measured to the 8 fl oz (225ml) level in a glass measuring jug 2 oz (sog) ghee (see page 25) or unsalted butter 4 whole cardamom pods A 1 inch (2.5cm) stick of cinnan1.on *teaspoon liquid yellow food colouring ! pint (275ml) water ! teaspoon salt 3! oz (9og) sugar, depending upon taste ! oz (ISg) blanched, slivered almonds 1 tablespoon sultanas Put the saffron in a small heavy frying pan set over a medium flame.

If liked, silver vark (see page 22) can be placed on the rice with a few sultanas and nuts on top. RELISHES, CHUTNEYS AND PICKLES 159 W like to perk up our meals in India with a variety of condiments. Their function, apart from teasing the palate with their sharp contrasts of sweet, sour, hot, and salty flavours, is to balance out the meal with added protein and vitamins. Sometimes, these condiments can be quite simple - cucumber wedges seasoned quickly with salt, pepper, cayenne, and lemon juice or chopped up onions and tomatoes. At other times we can serve pickles that have taken weeks or months to mature. Some condiments, such as the 'Fresh coriander chutney' or the 'Gujerati carrot salad', should be eaten up within 48 hours. Others, such as the 'Apple, peach and apricot chutney' and the 'Cauliflower and white radish pickle', may be kept for a year. Yoghurt relishes fall into another category. They can be condiments or they can be substantial dishes by themselves. Almost any herb or vegetable can be put into yoghurt, from mint to potatoes. Whenever I am serving an all Indian meal, I nearly always serve a yoghurt relish because it provides a cooling contrast. 160 RELISHES, CH TNEYS A D PICKLES Plain yoghurt Dahi Yoghurt is used in India for marinading meats - it tenderizes them, as a tart, creamy flavouring, and as an ingredient for sauces. As it is rich in protein, it is also eaten at almost every meal, either plain or mixed with seasonings and vegetables. It is a food that is easy to digest, far easier than milk. It is also considered a food that 'settles' the stomach, especially when combined with plain rice. Naturally, few respectable Indian homes are ever without it. Most of the time it is made at home, although it can be bought from the bazaar as well. To make yoghurt at home, you need milk, either whole or fat-free, and some 'starter'. This 'starter' is a few tablespoons of borrowed, leftover, or bought yoghurt. You also need a warm temperature that hovers between 85° and IOo°F (Jo- J8°C). This is the temperature at which yoghurt sets best. As this is not England's temperature normally, it has to be approximated. You could put the yoghurt in a warm cupboard near the water heater or in the oven of a cooker with a pilot light. The yoghurt bowl is also quite amenable to being wrapped in a blanket. I frequently resort to the blanket method. •i pints (1 litre) milk 2 tablespoons plain yoghurt Bring the milk to a boil in a heavy pot. As soon as the milk begins to rise, remove the pot from the cooker. Let the milk cool to anywhere between 100° and 1 I0°F (38- 43°C). It should feel warm to the touch. If a film forms over the top, just stir it in. Put the yoghurt in a 2 pint (1.25 litres) stainless steel or non-metallic bowl and beat it with a whisk until it is smooth and creamy. Slowly, add the warm milk, a little bit at a time and stirring as you do so. Cover the bowl and then wrap it in an old blanket or shawl without tilting it. Set it aside in a warm place free of draughts for 6- 8 hours, or until yoghurt has set. Store the yoghurt in a refrigerator. It should stay fresh for 4- 5 days.

I like to serve this with 'Lamb cooked with potatoes' (page 54), 'Gujerati-style green beans' (page 102) and either rice or an Indian bread. Serves 6: I medium-sized- 1i lb (s6og) aubergine, peeled and cut into 1 inch (2.5cm) cubes 20 fl oz (570ml) plain yoghurt i teaspoon salt, or to taste Freshly ground black pepper k teaspoon cayenne pepper, optional I spring onion, washed and cut into paper-thin rounds all the way up its green section 1 tablespoon finely chopped fresh mint A few mint leaves for garnishing Bring water in the bottom part of a steaming utensil to the boil. (If you do not have a steaming utensil, set a steaming trivet or a colander inside a large pot. Pour water into the pot in such a way that it stays just below the lowest part of the trivet or colander. Bring this water to a boil.) Put the aubergine cubes into the steamer section of your steaming utensil (or in to the trivet or colander), cover and steam over high heat for 10 minutes. Make sure that your boiling water does not run out. While the aubergine is steaming, put the yoghurt into a bowl and beat it lightly with a fork or a whisk until it is smooth and creamy. Add the salt, pepper, cayenne, spring onion, and mint to it. Mix with a fork. Lift out the steamed aubergine pieces and mash with a fork. Spread out the aubergine in a plate and leave to cool somewhat (or else the yoghurt would curdle). Fold the aubergine into the yoghurt and garnish with mint leaves. 164 RELISHES, CHUTNEYS AND PI CKLES Gujerati-style yoghurt with potatoes Batata nu raita This is an Indian potato salad except that we use seasoned yoghurt as a dressing instead of mayonnaise or a vinaigrette. In order to make the yoghurt very thick and creamy, it is generally hung up in a cheesecloth for an hour. You may omit this step if you are in a rush. You will, of course, end up with a more 'flowing' sauce, rather than one which clings to the potatoes. It may be served with 'Minced meat with peas' (page 44) and an Indian bread.

Drain them and let them cool for at least an hour. Set a sieve over a bowl and line it with a 15- 16 inch (38- 4ocm) square of doubled cheesecloth, muslin or a clean tea towel. Put the yoghurt into the cheesecloth. Now bring the four corners of the cheesecloth together. Use one of the corners to tie the cheesecloth into a bundle. Hang this bundle somewhere so it can drip for an hour. I usually hang it from the tap in my sink. Do not squeeze the cheesecloth. Just let it drip on its own. Empty the yoghurt into a bowl. Add about t teaspoon salt and some black pepper. Beat lightly with a fork or a whisk until the yoghurt is smooth and creamy. Taste for seasonings. Peel the potatoes and cut them into fi nch (zcm) dice. Heat the oil in a frying pan (non- stick is best) over a medium flame. When hot, put in the cumin seeds. Let the cumin seeds sizzle for 3- 4 seconds. Now put in the diced potatoes, about t teaspoon salt, some black pepper and the cayenne. Stir and cook the potatoes for about 4 minutes. Taste a potato piece for salt and other seasonings. You may make this dish as hot as you like. Take the frying pan off the heat and let the potatoes cool for 5 minutes. Pour the contents of the frying pan - oil, spices and potatoes - into the bowl with the yoghurt. Stir to mix and garnish, if you like, with fresh coriander or parsley.

Whether they are on buses, trains, cinema houses or in parks, they can be spotted opening up newspaper cones, unwrapping tea-cloth bundles or easing eager hands into terra cotta pots. Good things are hidden inside that can be nibbled upon for the satisfaction of the soul. Take samosas, for instance, those triangular, savoury pastries. The best place to eat them is right on the street, when the odours wafting from a near- by samosa-maker become too overwhelming to resist. All kinds of kebabs, marinated and grilled meat cubes, are also sold at open stalls. This is done deliberately to entice passing strollers. All workers in India stop for tea, a custom not too different from the British one. But what is served, is a bit different. T here would be tea of course, perhaps masala chai ('Spiced tea') or coffee. T hen, an odd assortment might appear - samosas, fried cashews, and, to sweeten the mouth, some carrot halva! All these dishes have been included in this chapter. T here are also snacks that may be served with drinks, such as cocktail koftas (meatballs) that lend themselves very well to having toothpicks stuck in them and spicy potato matchsticks. I have included some soups in this chapter as well. Even though we do not, as a nation drink soups, most Westernized Indians have happily adapted soups from other nations to suit their own tastes. Everyday meals in India generally end with fresh fruit - mangoes, pineapples, oranges, apples, pears, bananas, guavas, cherries, loquats, melons, jackfruit - whatever happens to be in season. F rui t is refreshing and cleansing - and a perfect conclusion to a spicy meal. In our family, my mother always peeled and cut the smaller fruit for all of us at the table. A plate was passed around and we took what we wanted. L arger, messier fruit, such as water melons, were cut in the kitchen before the meal and left to cool in the refrigerator. Desserts and sweetmeats are usually reserved for festive occasions. A wedding banquet invariably brings forth large vats filled with kul.fi - Indian ice cream - and at religious festivals some variety of halva is nearl y always served. 176 SOUPS, SNACKS, SAVOURI ES AND SWEETS Green soup Hara shorva This is India's version of cream of pea soup.

It was probably one of these that inspired Anglo-Indian communities three centuries ago to create a soup that had Indian spices and ingredients in it, yet could be served at the start of a meal. There are hundreds of recipes for mulligatawny soup in India, all slightly different. For this book, I have chosen one in which the base is a puree of red split lentils (masoor dal). It is a hearty soup that can almost be a meal in itself. I often have it for lunch with a simple green salad . It is traditional to have some plain boiled rice with this soup. I usually serve it on the side, in small quantities. r78 SOUPS, SNACKS, SAVOURI ES AND SWEETS Serves 4-6: 6 oz (qsg) red split lentils, picked over, washed, and drained 2 pints (1.25litres) chicken stock ! teaspoon ground turmeric 4 oz (IIog) potato I chicken breast, boned and skinned, with a net weight of about 7 oz (2oog) 1t teaspoon salt Freshly ground black pepper 5 cloves garlic, peeled A 1t inch (3cm) cube of fresh ginger, peeled and coarsely chopped 4! tablespoons plus 8 fl oz (225ml) water 3 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 teaspoon ground cumin seeds 1 teaspoon ground coriander seeds k-t teaspoon cayenne pepper About 1 tablespoon lemon juice (you might want more) Combine the lentils, chicken stock, and turmeric in a heavy, medium-sized pot and bring to a boil.

When the soup has cooked for half an hour, add the cut potato to it. Cover, leaving the lid slightly ajar again, and continue the simmering for another 30 minutes.

Remove all fat from the chicken breast and cut it into t inch (r em) dice. Put the chicken in a bowl. Sprinkle ± teaspoon salt and some black pepper over it. Toss to mix. Once the soup base has finished cooking, it needs to be pureed. I do this in a blender, in three batches. Put the pureed soup in a bowl. Add 1 teaspoon salt to it and mix. Rinse and wipe out your soup pot. Pour the oil into it and set it over a medium flame. When the oil is hot, put in the garlic-ginger paste, the cumin, coriander, and cayenne. Fry, stirring continuously, until the spice mixture is slightly browned and separates from the oil. Put in the chicken pieces. Stir and fry another 2- 3 minutes or until the chicken pieces turn quite opaque. Add 8 f1 oz (225ml) water and bring to a boil. Cover, turn heat to low, and simmer for 3 minutes or until chicken is cooked. Pour in the pureed soup and the lemon juice. Stir to mix and bring to a simmer. Taste the soup for seasonings.

They are partially prepared. A seasoned dough made from dried pulses has already been rolled out into the required shapes and then dried in the sun. All that you have to do is cook the poppadum. The cooking process is quick and easy. There are two basic methods to choose from. Deep-frying is the traditional method. This allows the poppadums to expand to their fullest and turn very airy. It also brings out their full flavour. This method does, however, leave those who are nibbling the poppadum with slightly greasy fingers. The second method is to roast the poppadums directly over or under a flame. This way you end up with clean fingers and poppadums with fewer calories. But the poppadums do not expand as much and remain denser than fried ones. Poppadums may be served with drinks or with Indian meals of any sort. Serves 6: The frying method: 6 poppadums Vegetable oil for deep- frying The roasting method: 6 poppadum Depending upon the size of the poppadum, either leave them whole or snap each into two halves. Remember that they will expand in the frying pan. Put about f inch (zcm) of oil in a frying pan and set it to heat over a medium flame. When hot, put in a poppadum (or half a poppadum, depending upon the size of the frying pan and poppadum). It will sizzle and expand within seconds. Remove the pop- padum with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. Cook all poppadum this way. Poppadums should retain their yellowish colour and not turn brown. They should also cook very fast. Adjust your heat, if necessary. Heat your grill. Put I poppadum on a rack and place it about 2- 3 inches (5- 7·5cm) under the grill. Now watch it very carefully. It will expand in seconds. It will also turn paler and develop a fc\\\\- bubbles. Turn it over and expose the second side to the flame for a second or so. Watch it all the time and do not I 8o SOUPS, SNACKS, SAVOUR!ES AND SWEETS Fried cashews Tale huay caju let it brown or burn. Remove from the grill. Make all poppadum this way. (When making poppadum under a grill, it is not always necessary to turn it over. You will have to use your own judgement here.) Poppadum may also be roasted directly on top of a live flame. Of course, you can only do this if you have a gas cooker. If you wish to follow this method, turn the flame on low. Now grip a poppadum with a set of tongs and hold it half an inch above the flame. The part of the poppadum that is directly over the flame will bubble and turn lighter in colour. When that happens, expose another part of the poppadum to the flame. Keep doing this until the entire poppadum has been roasted. Cashews that have been fresh ly fried at home have an exquisite taste, far better than that of the tinned and bottled variety. In India, this was the only kind of cashew we ate, with my mother frying the nuts just before my father sat down for his evening Scotch and soda. Raw cashews can be bought at most health-food stores. Serves 4-6: Vegetable oil for deep- frying ! lb (225g) raw cashew nuts ! teaspoon salt Freshly ground black pepper Put a sieve on top of a metal bowl and set it near the stove. Also, line two plates with kitchen paper and set them nearby. Heat about 1 inch (z.scm) of oil in a deep, 8 inch (2ocm) frying pan over a medium flame. When hot, put in all the cashews. Stir and fry them until they turn a reddish-gold colour. This happens fairly fast. Now empty the contents of the frying pan into the sieve to drain the oil. Lift up the sieve and shake out all the extra oil. Spread the cashews out on one of the plates and sprinkle the salt and pepper on them. Stir to mix. Now slide the cashews on to the second plate. This will take some more of the oil off them. Serve cashews warm or after they have cooled off.

T owards the end of the cooking period, you should scrape the bottom of the pot just to make sure the sauce is not catching. If necessary, add a tablespoon or so of water. Remove the lid and turn the heat up to medium low. Stir gently and cook until the meatballs have a browned look. All the sauce should now be clinging to the meatballs and there should be just a little fat left at the bottom of the pot. When you are ready to eat, heat the koftas gently. Lift them out of the fa t and shake off any whole spices that may be clinging to them. Stick a toothpick into each kofta if serving with drinks. If you have these koftas for dinner, you could leave more of a sauce. SOUPS, SNACKS, SAVOURI ES AND SWEETS 185 Tandoori-style prawns Tandoori jhinga These marinated prawns are traditionally cooked in a tandoor. Since the prawns generally available in Britain tend to be small, I cook them very quickly in a frying pan. You may easily double the recipe, if you wish to serve these prawns as a main course. Just use a larger frying pan. Serves 4 as a snack: 4 tablespoons plain yoghurt A 1 inch (2.5cm) cube of fresh ginger, peeled and very finely grated I large clove garlic, peeled and mashed to a pulp 5 teaspoons lemon juice ! teaspoon salt - or to taste Freshly ground black pepper 1! teaspoons ground roasted cumin seeds (see page q) ! teaspoon garam m.asala (see page 18) 2 teaspoons yellow liquid food colouring mixed with 1 teaspoon red liquid food colouring 8 oz (225g) peeled good quality prawns, defrosted and patted dry 2 oz (sog) unsalted butter Put the yoghurt in a bowl. Beat lightly with a fork or a whisk until it is smooth and creamy. Add the ginger, garlic, lemon juice, salt, some black pepper, roasted cumin, garam masala, and liquid food colouring. Stir to mix and set aside for 15 minutes. Push this liquid through a sieve into a second bowl. Add the prawns to the marinade and mix well. Set aside for 30 minutes. Remove the prawns with a slotted spoon, leaving all the marinade behind in the bowl. Melt the butter in a 8- 9 inch (20- 23cm) frying pan over a medium flame. When the butter has melted completely, turn heat to medium-high and immediately pour in the marinade. Stir and fry for a few minutes or until the butter separates and you have a thick bubbly sauce clinging to the bottom of the pan. Add the prawns and fold them in. Cook for a few minutes, stirring gently. Do not overcook the prawns. Stick toothpicks in the prawns and serve immediately. 186 SOUPS, SNACKS, SAVOURIES AND SWEETS Quick-fried prawns Tali hui jhinga You may stick toothpicks in these prawns and pass them around with drinks or serve them as a main course.

Set about rt inches (4cm) of oil to heat in a deep frying pan or other utensil for deep- frying over a medium flame. Meanwhile, dip the prawns in the flour mixture and coat them thoroughly. When the oil is hot, put in as many prawns as the utensil will hold in a single layer. Fry until the prawns turn slightly crisp on the outside - just a minute or so - turning them around whenever you need to. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. Do as many batches of prawns as you need to and serve them hot, with a little lemon juice squeezed over them. Deep-fried, stuffed, savoury pastry Samosa Samosas, generally eaten as a snack in India, make excellent appetizers. You may stuff them with almost anything, although traditional stuffings are either made out of spicy potatoes or ground meat. If you wish to use the ground meat stuffing, just use the recipe for minced lamb with mint (page 43). Boil away the liquid and drain the fat. Stuff each samosa with about zf tablespoons of the cooked mince. Samosas may be eaten with 'Fresh coriander chutney' (page r66) which serves as a dip. Here is my recipe for samosas with the potato stuffing: SOUPS, SNACKS, SAVOURIES AND SWEETS I 87 Makes 16 For the pastry ! lb (zzsg) plain flour ! teaspoon salt 4 tablespoons vegetable oil plus a bit more 4 tablespoons water For the stuffing 1 lb 10 oz (725g) potatoes, boiled in their jackets and allowed to cool 4 tablespoons vegetable oil 1 medium-sized onion, peeled and finely chopped 6 oz (175g) shelled peas, fresh or frozen (if frozen, defrost them first) 1 tablespoon finely grated peeled fresh ginger 1 fresh hot green chilli, finely chopped 3 tablespoons very finely chopped fresh green coriander 3 tablespoons water 1! teaspoons salt- or to taste 1 teaspoon ground coriander seeds 1 teaspoon garam masala (see page 18) 1 teaspoon ground roasted cumin seeds (see page 17) ! teaspoon cayenne pepper 2 tablespoons lemon juice Vegetable oil for deep- frying Sift the flour and salt into a bowl. Add the 4 tablespoons of vegetable oil and rub it in with your fingers until the mixture resembles coarse breadcrumbs. Slowly add about 4 tablespoons water - or a tiny bit more - and gather the dough into a stiff ball. Empty the ball out on to a clean work surface. Knead the dough for about 10 minutes or until it is smooth. Make a ball. Rub the ball with about t teaspoon oil and slip it into a polythene bag. Set it aside for 30 minutes or longer. Make the stuffing. Peel the potatoes and cut them into t inch dice. Heat 4 tablespoons oil in a large frying pan over a medium flame. When hot, put in the onions. Stir and fry them until they begin to turn brown at the edges. Add the peas, ginger, green chilli, fresh coriander, and 3 tablespoons water. Cover, lower heat and simmer until peas are cooked. Stir every now and then and add a little more water if the frying pan seems to dry out. Add the diced potatoes, salt, coriander, garam masala, roasted cumin, cayenne, and lemon juice. Stir to mix. Cook on low heat for 3- 4 minutes, stirring gently as you do so. Check balance of salt and lemon juice. You may want more of both. Turn off the heat and allow the mixture to cool. Knead the pastry dough again and divide it into 8 balls. Keep 7 covered while you work with the eighth. Roll this ball out into a 7 inch (18cm) round. Cut it into half with a sharp, pointed knife. Pick up one half and form a cone, making a t inch wide (smm), overlap- ping seam. Glue this seam together with a little water. Fill the cone with about 2f tablespoons of the potato mixture. Close the top of the cone by sticking the open edges together with a little water. Again, your seam should be about t inch (smm) wide. Press the top seam down with the prongs of a fork or flute it with your fingers. Make 7 more samosas. 188 SOUPS, SNACKS, SAVOURIES AND SWEETS H eat about It- z inches (4- scm) of oil for deep-frying over a medium-low flame.

Serves 4-6 with drinks: 4 oz (11og) onion, peeled and coarsely chopped 2-3 cloves garlic, peeled 1 dried, hot red chilli (use m.ore if you want the potatoes to be more than mildly hot) 1 teaspoon ground cumin seeds 1 teaspoon ground coriander seeds 1 lb (45og) potatoes Enough vegetable oil to have 1 inch (1cm) in a big frying pan f-1 teaspoon salt Put the onion, garlic, and red chilli into the container of an electric blender or food processor. Blend until you have a paste, pushing down with a rubber spatula, if necessary. Empty the paste into a bowl. Add the cumin and coriander and mix them in. Peel the potatoes and cut them into i inch (3mm) thick slices. You may use a mandolin, food processor, or knife to do this. Stack about 5 slices together at a time and cut them into i inch (3mm) wide matchsticks.

Fry all the potatoes this way, spreading out each batch on the kitchen paper. Take the frying pan off the fire and remove all but 4 tablesp0ons of the oil. Put the frying pan back on the medium flame and pour in the spice mixture from the bowl. Stir and fry it until it is brown and fairly dry. Take your time to do this, turning the heat down a bit if you think it is necessary. Now put in all the fried potatoes and the salt. Stir to mix, breaking up spice lumps as you do so.

SOUPS, SNACKS, SAVOUR IES AND SWEETS 191 Vermicelli pudding S eviyan ki kheer In India, we use a very thin, delicate vermicelli known as seviyan to make this pudding. Since this is available only in Indian stores, I have worked out a recipe for the vermicelli that can be found in most supermarkets. Serves 6-8: 2 oz (sog) unsalted butter 3 oz (75g) vermicelli, broken into 2 inch (scm) lengths 2! pints (1.5 litre) hot milk ! teaspoon cardamon seeds, crushed to a powder in a mortar 2 tablespoons sultanas 1 oz (25g) chopped almonds ! oz (15g) finely chopped pistachios (use more almonds as a substitute) 4 oz (11og) sugar (or to taste) Melt the butter in a heavy saucepan over a medium-low flame. Put in the vermicelli. Stay watchful now. Stir and fry the vermicelli until the pieces turn golden brown. This happens rather suddenly. Some pieces will be darker than others. That is to be expected. Pour in the hot milk and bring to a simmer. Now adjust the heat to medium-low or whatever temperature keeps the milk simmering vigor- ously without letting it boil over. Add the cardamom seeds, sultanas, and almonds. Let the milk simmer vigorously for about 20 minutes. Stir frequently during this period. Add the sugar and cook another 5 minutes. You should now have about 2 pints (1.25 litres) of pudding or a bit less. Pour the pudding into a bowl and allow to turn lukewarm. Stir a few times as this happens. A skin will form at the top. Just stir it in. Pour the lukewarm pudding into a single serving bowl or into several individual bowls (or ice-cream cups). Garnish with the pista- chios, cover with cling film, and refrigerate. Serve cold. 192 SOUPS, SNACKS, SAVOURIES AND SWEETS Carrot hal va Gajar ka halva Serves 4: 1 lb (45og) carrots I i pints ( 70oml) milk 8 whole cardamom pods 5 tablespoons vegetable oil or ghee 5 tablespoons castor sugar 1- 2 tablespoons sultanas 1 tablespoon shelled, unsalted pistachios, lightly crushed 10 fl oz (275ml) clotted or double cream, optional Ice cream with nuts Kulji Peel the carrots and grate them either by hand or in a food processor. Put the grated carrots, milk, and cardamom pods in a heavy- bottomed pot and bring to a boil. Turn heat to medium and cook, stirring now and then, until there is no liquid left. Adjust the heat, if you need to. T his boiling down of the milk will take you at least half an hour or longer, depending upon the width of your pot. H eat the oil in a non-stick frying pan over a medium-low flame. When hot, put in the carrot mixture. Stir and fry until the carrots no longer have a wet, milky look. They should turn a rich, reddish colour. T his can take IO- I S minutes. Add the sugar, sultanas, and pistachios. Stir and fry another 2 minutes. This halva may be served warm or at room temperature. Serve the cream on the side, for those who want it. As far as I can remember, we never made ku!ji at home. This may well have been because it was served always to hundreds of people at wedding banquets. Only a professional ku!ji-rvallah could be entrusted with such a monstrous task. Orders were placed with him weeks in advance. On the day of the banquet, he arrived with assistants, usually his sons and brothers, carrying enormous earthenware vats. The vats were set up somewhere outdoors, usually at the edge of a vast lawn. Each vat contained lots of broken ice and, embedded in the ice, hundreds of tube shaped terra cotta containers fill ed with ku!ji. Every now and then the ku!ji-rvallah would ease his arm into the vats and give its contents a knowing swish. We were never allowed to ask for a ku!ji until the main meal, set up under brightly appliqued tents, had finished. SOUPS, SNACKS, SAVOURI ES AND SWEETS 193 Kulji is not difficult to make at home as I have discovered in the years that I have been deprived oflocal kulji-maflas. All you need is an adequate freezer. (If any of you have an ice cream machine, you may use it for kulji.) Kulji is not made with cream but with reduced milk. It helps to have a very heavy pot with an even distribution of heat for boiling down the milk. A heavy, non- stick pan would also do. Serves 6: 3! pints (2 litres) milk 10 whole cardamom pods 4- stablespoonssugar ! oz (10g) chopped, blanched almonds r oz (25g) chopped, unsalted pistachios Bring the milk to the boil in a heavy pot. As soon as the milk begins to rise, turn the heat down, adjusting it to allow the milk to simmer vigorously without boiling over. Add the cardamom pods. The milk has to reduce to about a third of its original amount, that is, to about It pints (7ooml). Stir frequently as this happens. Whenever a film forms on top of the milk, just stir it in. When the milk has reduced, remove the cardamom pods and discard them. Add the sugar and almonds. Stir and simmer gently for 2- 3 minutes. Pour the reduced milk into a bowl and let it cool completely. Add half of the pistachios and stir them in. Cover the bowl with aluminium foil and put it in the freezer. (If you have an ice cream machine, you could empty the contents of the bowl into the machine and get it going.) Put 6 small, individual cups, empty yogurt cartons or a rt pint (8soml) pudding basin into the freezer. Every IS minutes or so, remove the ice cream bowl from the freezer and give the ice cream a good stir in order to break up the crystals. As the ice cream begins to freeze, it will become harder and harder to stir it. When it becomes almost impossible to stir, take the containers out of the freezer. Work quickly now. Divide the ice cream between the cups or empty into the pudding basin. Sprinkle the remaining pistachios over the top. Cover the cups or basin with aluminium foil, crinkling the edges to seal them. Put into the freezer and let the ice cream harden. I94 SOUPS, SNACKS, SAVOURIES AND SWEETS Mangoes Good mangoes are amongst the best fruit on earth. They can be found in Great Britain in two basic forms, tinned and fresh. T he tinned ones come sliced, or as a puree. I rarely serve the slices as I find their texture to be pathetically mushy but I do use the puree. I often chill it thoroughly and then swirl it into a bowl filled with double the amoun t of whipped cream. I then sprinkle some toasted almonds or pistachios over the top. It is a very simple dessert. Very refreshing too. Fresh mangoes are another matter. If you ever see good ones (those with a strong mango aroma), such as the alphonso from the Bombay region, do buy them. Remember, though, that many grocers sell mangoes that are not full y ripe - those that are hard to the touch - because they have a long shelf life. Such mangoes may be ripened at home. Just wrap them individually in newspaper and then put them in a covered basket or cardboard box. Leave this container in a warm place (such as the kitchen) until the mangoes are ripe. A ripe mango should yeild slightl y when pressed. After the mangoes have ripened, they should be chilled, peeled and sliced. M angoes do ha ve stones. So you have to slice around them. Do not throw the stones away before nibbling off all the flesh first!

However, evidence suggests that the Mayans learnt their knowledge from an earlier Olmec culture, around 1500-400 Be. Mayan traders would have introduced the cacao bean to the Aztecs and it soon became of huge importance in both cultures. Warriors and noblemen were buried with vessels for drinking chocolate and chocolate was offered to the gods as ceremonial gifts. Christopher Columbus was known to have brought back some cocoa beans to the Spanish court but it wasn't until later when Cortes returned from the New World that the popularity of the cocoa bean really took off. So a commodity was born that generated great power and wealth. The Spanish were credited with giving chocolate its name- an amalgam of the Mayan 'chocol', meaning hot, and the Aztec 'atl', meaning water. By the 1600s chocolate was known throughout Europe although it seems to have been its mythical medicinal qualities that first appealed to people. Chocolate does in fact contain a small amount of phenylethylamine, which is a chemical that produces a feeling of a natural 'high'. It was the arrival of sugar from America that really cemented the popularity of chocolate. Drinking sweetened chocolate became a popular pastime although still only for the wealthy.

Nuts, fruit and flavourings were added, chocolate was moulded into different shapes and filled with soft fondant or liqueurs. There is always a heated debate as to which country makes the finest chocolates. Belgium, Switzerland or France all have a good case to put forward but ultimately it comes down to personal tastes. Some diehard chocoholics would not touch a bitter square of plain chocolate yet others see milk chocolate as an inferior product, barely worthy of being called chocolate at all. Whatever your view there is no disputing that chocolate is one of life's great pleasures. J ' j C HOCOLATE GALORE COOKING WITH CHOCOLATE AA with all thin3..s, the better the ~ualitJ the better the ta..ste and chocolate i..s no exception. Nowadays the range of superior-quality chocolate available is enormous. There is absolutely no excuse to buy what they call chocolate-flavour cake covering. Avoid it at all costs. Professional confectioners tend to use couverture chocolate. It has a high cocoa butter content and so melts easily and when set has a pleasing glossy finish. However it is only available in specialist shops so is not used in any of these recipes. For the fullest flavour I recommend chocolate with at least 70% cocoa solids but in some recipes its intensity is overpowering and so a chocolate with 50% cocoa solids actually produces a more delicate flavour. If it is not obvious from the front, if you read the list of ingredients on the back of a bar of chocolate it will tell you the amount of cocoa solids present. You will also find that chocolate with less cocoa solids will melt more easily and will be less likely to 'seize'. This is when the chocolate overheats and becomes stiff and grainy. It will also seize when any cold moisture comes into contact with it. This is why it is essential to let melted chocolate cool a little before incorporating it with anything else. * .", "labels": ["Irrelevant"]}, "id": "J2wll4gykO", "from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels"}, {"value": {"start": 3255, "end": 3273, "text": "THE CHOCOLATE BAR ", "labels": ["Recipe_Steps"]}, "id": "ejgnLXVrzL", "from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels"}, {"value": {"start": 3614, "end": 3774, "text": "The chocolate is constantly moved at a temperature of between 55- 85°( thus exposing it to air, which improves its flavour and extracts more fat from the cocoa.", "labels": ["Recipe_Steps"]}, "id": "KKX1Xfbx83", "from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels"}, {"value": {"start": 6170, "end": 6930, "text": " Start off on high power but for 10-20 seconds at a time.

However, evidence suggests that the Mayans learnt their knowledge from an earlier Olmec culture, around 1500-400 Be. Mayan traders would have introduced the cacao bean to the Aztecs and it soon became of huge importance in both cultures. Warriors and noblemen were buried with vessels for drinking chocolate and chocolate was offered to the gods as ceremonial gifts. Christopher Columbus was known to have brought back some cocoa beans to the Spanish court but it wasn't until later when Cortes returned from the New World that the popularity of the cocoa bean really took off. So a commodity was born that generated great power and wealth. The Spanish were credited with giving chocolate its name- an amalgam of the Mayan 'chocol', meaning hot, and the Aztec 'atl', meaning water. By the 1600s chocolate was known throughout Europe although it seems to have been its mythical medicinal qualities that first appealed to people. Chocolate does in fact contain a small amount of phenylethylamine, which is a chemical that produces a feeling of a natural 'high'. It was the arrival of sugar from America that really cemented the popularity of chocolate. Drinking sweetened chocolate became a popular pastime although still only for the wealthy. C HOCO LATE GALO RE * THE CHOCOLATE BAR * The idea of mixing cocoa butter, the by-product of making cocoa powder, with the powder itself came about in the early 1800s. A smooth paste, solid when cold, was created that gave us the early form of what we know as the chocolate bar. It was the Swiss who refined the art of chocolate making by inventing t he process known as conching. The chocolate is constantly moved at a temperature of between 55- 85°( thus exposing it to air, which improves its flavour and extracts more fat from the cocoa. The Swiss also developed the milk chocolate bar by adding dried milk to the chocolate-making process. White chocolate is not strictly chocolate as it does not contain cocoa mass but is a blend of cocoa butter, sugar and milk solids. * Llh\\ITLESS FLAVOURS * As the flavour of chocolate improved so chefs were inspired to create wonderful confections. Nuts, fruit and flavourings were added, chocolate was moulded into different shapes and filled with soft fondant or liqueurs. There is always a heated debate as to which country makes the finest chocolates. Belgium, Switzerland or France all have a good case to put forward but ultimately it comes down to personal tastes. Some diehard chocoholics would not touch a bitter square of plain chocolate yet others see milk chocolate as an inferior product, barely worthy of being called chocolate at all. Whatever your view there is no disputing that chocolate is one of life's great pleasures. J ' j C HOCOLATE GALORE COOKING WITH CHOCOLATE AA with all thin3..s, the better the ~ualitJ the better the ta..ste and chocolate i..s no exception. Nowadays the range of superior-quality chocolate available is enormous. There is absolutely no excuse to buy what they call chocolate-flavour cake covering. Avoid it at all costs. Professional confectioners tend to use couverture chocolate. It has a high cocoa butter content and so melts easily and when set has a pleasing glossy finish. However it is only available in specialist shops so is not used in any of these recipes. For the fullest flavour I recommend chocolate with at least 70% cocoa solids but in some recipes its intensity is overpowering and so a chocolate with 50% cocoa solids actually produces a more delicate flavour. If it is not obvious from the front, if you read the list of ingredients on the back of a bar of chocolate it will tell you the amount of cocoa solids present. You will also find that chocolate with less cocoa solids will melt more easily and will be less likely to 'seize'. This is when the chocolate overheats and becomes stiff and grainy. It will also seize when any cold moisture comes into contact with it. This is why it is essential to let melted chocolate cool a little before incorporating it with anything else. * .£ELTING CHOCOLATE * I have to say I always use a microwave to melt chocolate but you have to bear in mind that microwave power varies greatly. Start off on high power but for 10-20 seconds at a time. This way you won't burn the chocolate and you will soon find how long your own microwave takes to melt the chocolate. In general it takes between 1 and 2 minutes to melt a bowl of chocolate but obviously the larger the quantity the longer it will take. If you don't have a microwave you will need to fit a mixing bowl or pudding basin over the top of a saucepan with a small quantity of hot water in the bottom. This is then placed over a gentle heat until the chocolate melts. The most important thing is not to let the bowl come into contact with the water. Not only will the chocolate overheat, but the water sputters out from the sides and comes into contact with the chocolate, which then seizes. Some people with Agas swear by melting chocolate in a bowl in the bottom oven and the few times I have tried this it seems to work very well. In some cases you can melt chocolate over a direct heat but only when the chocolate is being melted with another liquid such as cream. Never melt chocolate on its own over a direct heat. INTRODUCTION * TE.£PERING CHOCOLATE * Tempering is the name given to the process whereby chocolate is melted and worked to produce a chocolate with a glossy, even finish. If you want a professional finish to confectionery, especially when making moulded chocolate, you will need to temper the chocolate. However, it is tricky due to the precise temperatures requ ired for heating and cooling and will take a bit of practice. The simplest method is to melt the chocolate then pour two-thirds onto a marble slab. With a palette knife work it backwards and forwards until it is just on the point of setting. Return it to the remaining third and remelt it. It can now be used for moulds and decorations.

Putting the chocolate in the refridgerator melted chocolate and snip a tiny bit off the end. Then for 15 minutes will make it easier to grate. Try not you can write or drizzle the melted chocolate over the to handle the chocolate as it wi ll melt more quickly. surface. When it is on the point of setting chocolate Wrapping the end of the chocolate in foil will prevent ganache (see page 154) the heat from your hands melting the chocolate. can be piped using an ordinary piping bag and starred nozzle. * <(.UICK CHOCOLATe CURLS * First make sure the chocolate is at room temperature. With a potato peeler, peel off little curls from the edge of the chocolate bar. * CHOCOLATE CARA<GUE * Another name for big chocolate curls. Melt 120-150g chocolate and pour over a marble slab. Leave it to harden. It needs to be hard but not completely set. At a 45° angle to the surface draw the blade of a small sharp knife across the chocolate, away from the body. Turn the point of the knife a little as if you are about to trace a circle. The chocolate should form long curls. It is crucial to get the correct angle of the blade and also that the chocolate is at the right temperature. Too hot and the curls will collapse and too cold, i.e. set, and the chocolate will form shards rather than curls. BUJING & STORING CHOCOLATE INTRODUCTION * CHOCOLATE LEAVES * Firstly you will need the leaves of a non-toxic plant. Rose and bay leaves are best as they have well-defined veins. Wash the leaves and leave to dry completely. Melt the chocolate and paint the underside of the leaves with chocolate. Leave to harden and set, then carefully peel off the leaves. Always check the use by date on chocolate as some shops are less than scrupulous about their stock turnover. Plain chocolate tends to have a longer shelf life than milk chocolate, about one year compared to six months. Always keep chocolate in a cool, dry place. If it is very hot it can be kept in the refrigerator but it can become discoloured due to the difference in temperatures. This does not affect its flavour and it can be used in the normal way.

The flavour of salted butter can really spoil a dessert or confectionery as can cheap margarine. * COCOA PO(IJDER * Cocoa powder is chocolate liquor that has had most of the cocoa butter removed and is dried into a very fine powder. Whatever you do don't confuse cocoa powder with drinking chocolate. Cocoa powder is unsweetened and should have no other additives. Dutch cocoa powder is the best as it is processed to reduce the acids that occur naturally in chocolate. * PLAIN CHOCOLATE * Most recipes will specify which plain chocolate to use, usually between 50 and 70% cocoa solids. Taste different brands to find your favourite as they can vary greatly. * £ILK CHOCOLATE * There is a huge difference between good and bad milk chocolate. Try and buy one of the expensive brands and you really will notice the difference, both in flavour and textu re. * WHITE CHOCOLATE * As mentioned, white chocolate is not actually chocolate at all as it contains no cocoa solids. Cheap white chocolate can be tricky to melt and can seize very easily if it comes into contact with a liquid or even a utensil with a different temperature. I always warm a metal spoon under hot water for a minute and dry it really well before using it to stir melted white chocolate. INTRODUCTION * COUVERTURE CHOCOLATE * Couverture chocolate is what professional chocolatiers use for their work. It has a high cocoa butter content that when melted, produces a runny chocolate that covers in an even, glossy finish. E<GUIP£ENT Apart from the obvious cake tins, muffin tins etc. there is not much specialist equipment needed for cooking with chocolate. However, a sugar thermometer is essential for a few of the recipes in the Chocolaterie chapter and is a great help for other recipes. Most good cookshops sell them. Another invaluable item in the kitchen is nonstick baking parchment. Even if you have non-stick bakeware it is best to base-line your tins. If you have a food processor with a balloon whisk and dough hook attachments all the better, but it is not a necessity. To incorporate as much air as possible into your baking it is best to have an electric hand-held whisk.

FIVE DECADES OF BAKING - -·--- - --------, All my life, I have been surrounded by great baking. I've been in the industry for more than thirty years, and yet every day I learn something new. My childhood was in Merseyside and I grew up eating my mum's bakes at home- her ginger biscuits are legendary- and I was always in and out of my dad's bakeries. Following in his footsteps, I did an apprenticeship in high-street bakeries, then began working in five-star hotels. I moved to Cyprus in my late twenties, living and baking there for six years, as well as travelling around the Mediterranean and Middle East, learning about many different styles ofbread and pastry. Coming back to Britain, I set up my own bakeries and I also started to teach baking on television shows. Then one day I got a call asking me to audition as a presenter for a new programme: The Great British Bake Off So started a whole new chapter in my life. Through television, books and other forms of teaching, I'm proud to have been part of a revival of baking in Britain, and the celebration of one of our great national traditions. You don't have to go to college to make a career in baking. I learnt on the job; from reading and by watching other people, but most of all from doing. I've taught perhaps forty people how to bake professionally over the years, some of them from scratch. What matters most, whether amateur or professional, is hands- on experience and the ability and willingness to pick things up. What other qualities help? If you're making puff pastry, croissants, creme pat, bread or any number of other things, you need patience. And to be patient, you need passion. Because even if you fail, you'll do it again and again until you get it right; once you've got it right, you'll never forget. 8 The other key lesson is the importance of touch. Ifl go into a bakery, I can put my finger in a dough and tell you how that bread will come out of the oven- how it'll bake, how it'll look, what the crust is going to be like. That's purely the result of experience, which anyone can build up day by day. Get the knowledge in your fingertips. My dad always encouraged me to use my hands, and I've passed that on to everyone who's ever worked with me. Do something by hand, however much it seems like hard work, and you'll get to know the texture of what you're making. This goes for fillings and decoration too. A lot of people over-whip cream. If you use an electric whisk, you should always under-whip and then take it to the right consistency by hand, lifting the whisk up to see when it's ready. Cooks go by their own taste buds, altering recipes to suit their preferences- putting a little bit more in, tasting as they go. Baking is a different sort of skill. Bakers are scientific. You can play with the flavours in a bake but there's an underlying strategy and science. You have to do things precisely, weighing up the ingredients and getting the timing right. It's all about the chemistry, such as the rising agent's reaction to liquid, and how the salt and fat work with the flour and yeast. Fermentation is key - the way that a dough's flavour develops over time and how this is affected by the temperature of the air and water. Ingredients make a real difference too- the type ofbutter and the eggs used in a mixture and the way they emulsify. And then there's the importance of using your oven properly, taking care over any decoration and knowing the simple tricks that make a bake look great. There are two aspects to any bake: one is the base recipe; the other is flavour. Follow the base recipe to the letter initially- whether it's a Victoria sponge, Genoise, bread or croissant, don't change the recipe. When it comes to flavours, though, you can play around. You might think you need some more raspberries, 9 or cut them back, or change onions to mushrooms. But only do that after you've mastered the base recipe first and made it two or three times, so you have confidence in what you're doing. Ingredients do differ and you have to notice and respond to that as you bake. Different brands of flour may absorb up to five per cent more or less liquid. A good flour will absorb more liquid, which will give your bake more volume. Try the same recipe with different flours and you'll see the difference, and discover your own preferences. There's a plethora of equipment around these days to make baking easier. But in the end I prefer to use as little kit as possible. All you really need is a bread scraper, a good serrated knife and digital scales. A set of digital scales is the item of equipment that has really changed home baking, and is essential. I started with balance scales at work and they were fine for 20kg quantities, but when you're dealing in hundreds of grams digital precision makes a real difference. Bread scrapers are great for cutting dough and scraping it off surfaces, or smoothing icing on the top or sides of a cake. When you get one for the first time, you realise what you've been missing. I've used a Scotch scraper for forty years and I'll never be without one. A serrated knife is the most effective tool for cutting bakes. You can use it for cutting a sponge into discs, just as you do for slicing bread. Bakeware is much better than it used to be. It's worth buying good -quality trays and tins, as they'll last longer and won't warp. If you buy decent kit, the only thing you'll ever have to change is the battery in your digital scales. Baking teaches you patience and creativity, but more than that it teaches you what goes into your food. It helps you learn about ingredients and what they do in pastries, cakes and pies. It's also a family thing. Once a recipe is good, you can pass it on to 10 the rest of your family so they continue to make it. That's why it's very nostalgic -when people watch Bake Off and see a particular kind of cake, they think, 'My grandma used to make a cake like that and it was delicious,' then they want to make it themselves. Home baking and passing down these recipes has long been a tradition in Britain. We have always been good bakers in this country, but people sometimes forget that fact. I think people here are bakers before they are cooks. One reason is that cooking can be about sourcing special ingredients, whereas baking starts with the basics. Flour, sugar, salt and yeast are what we use- all raw ingredients that you have already in the cupboard. Anyone can bake, and you can start at any age. If you can get a few core bakes right - a Victoria sandwich, a favourite bread, a beautiful brioche, a buttery croissant- you will enter a whole new world of enjoyment, and save yourself money in the shops at the same time. Over the years, I've not only perfected my techniques and recipes, but also come to understand what it means to be a baker. The things I've learnt from decades as a professional are just as useful for the home baker who wants to make a weekend loaf, a batch ofbiscuits, a pie, a pud, a tart or a celebration cake. So this is what I'm sharing with you now- the recipes, lessons and experiences from my baker's life. A NOTE ON OVEN TEMPERATURE The baking times in m y recipes are for conventional ovens. If you are using a fan-assisted oven, you will need to lower the oven setting by around 1 0- 15°C. Ovens vary, so use an oven thermometer to verify the temperature and check your bakes towards the end of the suggested cooking time. 11 YOU ASSOCIATE YOUR childhood withfoodbecauseitmakes such an impact at the time. Sweet foods and other bakes are treats. They mean you've been good, or are having a good time. These are the moments that you find yourself remembering decades later. Baking is in my genes. My dad was a baker and when I was born in 1966 we lived in a flat above his shop. He would start work at 4am and the flat was permanently full of the smell ofbread. When my mum came down to gel the doughnuts she would hang me on a baby bouncer at the bottom of the stairs by the shop. I'd bounce away for hours, watching people bake. We moved to asemi-detachedhouse in Wallasey, in the Wirral, when I was very young and that's where I grew up. We were a very tight community where everyone knew each other and the kids all played outside in the street. My mum still lives in the same house, and she was born and raised in the next road. My mum hates cooking but she's creative- she worked as a graphic artist- and her pastry work and her biscuits were great. We were much involved in the church and that's where I saw a lot of cakes, bread and, predominantly, tray bakes. If someone had a birthday, we'd have a big bash or we'd go on an outing, perhaps to the seaside, and everyone would bring food to the table- my nan and mum included. Nowadays people are baking at home much more again but there was a gap of around twenty years when people just bought pre-made food. What I am part of now is a return to that ethos ofbakingyourself. On a Saturday, my mum used to make a fruit pie for Sunday lunch, all from scratch. The fruit- rhubarb, apples or pears- was always home-grown. I would climb the apple tree in our garden with my two younger brothers, Jason and Lee, partly to pick apples and partly to get onto the shed roof to be naughty and throw stones. NOSTALGIC BAKES 14 I t I ~ Saturday was a fun day; there was no school and my dad was off work so I'd get to see him. In the afternoon, he'd bake bread rolls, making dough in a bowl, shaping the buns and putting them on a tray to rise in front of a gas fire with a damp cloth over the top. I remember lifting the cloth to have a quick look. They were growing. Then he baked them off, and they were absolutely delicious. I would recognise that flavour anywhere; it's the taste of something home-made. My dad was a baker who knew his stuff, and he understood that the longer you rise a bread before you knock it back and let the shaped loaf prove (grow again), the greater the flavour. It's down to fermentation- one of the most important lessons for any baker. While the rolls were proving, I remember Dad sitting down and watching the wrestling on a Saturday- invariably Big Daddy was up against Giant Haystacks- and we'd be there, me and my two brothers. Then we would watch a bit of the Generation Game, a TV game show where novices tried to copy a skill demonstrated by a professional. At the age of six, I remember seeing a guy plaiting bread and being fascinated. Thirty-odd years later, I went on the Generation Game myself and plaited bread, just like that baker. My nans- Olive and Amy -lived in fiats above shops in big Victorian houses and they each had a minute kitchen and a pantry. The smell ofbaking always struck me in my dad's mum's house. She ran a launderette until she was eighty. Tough as old boots. She used to say to me, 'Your dad's the best baker in the country. He works all the hours God sends.' So I grew up with this sense of good baking. Both sides of the family were grafters. My great-great-great grandfather on Mum's side used to run across Scotland and back in a week, delivering and collecting the post for his community on the west coast. It was the equivalent of about twenty-one marathons a month. I didn't know that when I was growing up, NOSTALGIC BAKES 15 - I l but I had a lot of energy as a child- in double-games I would opt to run round and round a field without stopping- and later on, I regularly did thirteen- or fourteen-hour shifts as a baker. My dad built up achainofbakeries in the Northeast and as a child and teenager I'd go along with him to help out or watch the lads work. There was a very old stainless steel machine that was used to pierce each doughnut, then you'd pull two levers to inject the perfect amount of jam. Sometimes I'd do it with my brother and we'd go ge-dung, ge-dung, ge-dung, putting more and more jam in until the doughnuts became like jam bombs. My dad's bakeries were all open plan. In the front, there was the shop area displaying all the cakes and cream cakes, the steak and kidney pies, the sausage rolls and the bread on racks. Then you would swing round to a patisserie area with rum truffles and little brownies. I used to disappear off and talk to the people in the shop, to ask ifl could take a cream doughnut. It would seem almost as big as my head but I'd eat the lot. My dad would go mad, saying, 'Why's he doing that- he won't eat his dinner!' I had no idea that I wanted to be a baker back then. At the time I was just fascinated by baking and everything that went with it -the white aprons hanging on washing lines with Dad's checks, white t-shirts and long white coats. Ifl hugged my dad when he came back from work, he always had that smell ofbread. Years later, I remember coming home from my bakery and my lad Joshua saying to me: 'Dad, you smell like a loaf!'

All it takes is that little bit of ambition to have a go in the first place- and it's easier than you think. Bread-making machines can be a good way to start, as all you have to do is weigh up ingredients and then leave the machine to it. The next step is to make a loaf that you knead yourself; you'll have more control this way because when you touch a dough, you can feel that it's lively and good, and you can smell it as well. How did I learn? In my mid-teens, I'd followed my mum's path and went to Wallasey Art School, where I got particularly into sculpture. My dad now lived in York and had a chain of about eighteen bakeries. When Dad asked me ifi wanted to become a baker, I initially said no. Then he offered to pay me £500- a lot of money in those days- ifi'd cut my long hair and join the industry. That put things in a different light for a seventeen-year-old! I set out to become a baker. My dad put me to work with the best guys he had at each of the bakeries, to train me in their particular skills; they were mostly old school bakers and all great at their jobs. I also picked up the basic know-how of working in a bakery, such as not to just grab a tray but always tap it first to avoid getting burnt. Being the son of the boss means you always get the toughest jobs. I had a lot to prove, so I had to work twice as hard as anyone else. The shift started at one o'clock in the morning and we finished about ten hours later. I used to like working through the night, when it was quiet, finishing midway through the day with a huge sense of relief. But this was six days a week and it was gruelling work. I was only young when I started, and I was working alongside big stocky lads from Bootle. These lads were much bigger than me and they were lugging flour bags I could barely lift- a minimum of16kg", "labels": ["Irrelevant"]}, "id": "mvdDuYJ9ea", "from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels"}, {"value": {"start": 60091, "end": 64080, "text": "BEGINNER'S BREAD 62 r- -- - --~ I and you'd sometimes carry a couple on each shoulder when the flour delivery for the week came on a Thursday. You build up your body quickly carrying sacks like that, as well as big hot trays on your fingertips. Within six months, I was as quick and strong as they were. When you begin as an apprentice baker, you're a mixing lad or a table hand. Mixing starts with measuring. This is as important for the home baker as for the professional. If you don't weigh up the ingredients properly at the beginning- a half ounce out, either way - you've screwed up the whole process. And, just as for the home baker, the quality of the ingredients has got to be right: put rubbish in, you'll get rubbish out. The next job I learnt was to 'scale off' llb or 2lb pieces of dough on an old-fashioned scale with weights on one side and a pan on the other. You had to do it quick: bang, bang, bang, bang. There might be six or seven guys waiting to mould the dough into cobs, cottage loaves or tin loaves. After that, you moved on to the table. Moulding is a manual skill. Once you've got it, it never leaves you. Some are faster than others; I tended to be fairly quick. I am rubbish at academic stuff, but manual? You show me something once and I won't stop until I've mastered it. Finally comes the most important job- and this person really runs the bakery - feeding the oven. My first was an eight-foot oven with five decks and three trays on each one. I twas huge and made your back strain from lifting trays and filling it from top to bottom. You cannot, cannot have an empty space in the oven from the moment you start to the end of the day. Electric or gas, that oven's costing you money and you have to keep it baking at all times. You spend the whole shift juggling and figuring out where the heat is in your oven and the best position to bake things in. Every deck has its own character. You have to know where the BEGINNER'S BREAD 63 - hot spots are, the best place for the Genoise or the barm cakes. Learn to love your oven and it can be your best friend - or else it can be your worst enemy. In a bakery shift, you start with the breads. Because they need the greatest heat, they go in when the oven has been fired up. You pop the meringues in last thing, when the oven is cooling down, leave the oven door open and take the trays out the next day, first thing. Early on, I made the classic mistake of coming in, closing the oven door, firing up the oven and burning all the meringues. My dad's chain ofbakeries was what we called 'hot bread shops', designed so you could see and talk to the baker working at the back. Old dears would come in and say, 'Put that loafback in and burn it for me.' They like bread darker in the North, with more of a caramel colour and a crust; down South they prefer it lighter. Looking back, working in this type of shop meant I saw that bakers didn't have to be stuck away but could be out and about, talking about what we do. One day when I was working in the Lincoln shop, the head baker didn't turn up. As assistant baker, I took over. It all turned out beautifully. I was really proud of the cakes, scones, pies, breads, baps, harms, sticks, tin breads. Everything was great. I thought: I understand now. All it took was someone to be off for me to take responsibility and to do it myself. The lessons I learnt translate to home baking. First of all, get stuck in. Making bread is so satisfying and every time you learn more about each stage. Get a decent set of digital scales and weigh your ingredients accurately. Get your oven clean so you haven't got hot spots in there. Try not to open the oven door too often. Ideally, have an oven with a glass front and clean the front window, then either turn the light on inside or use a torch if you need to look inside without opening the door. Make the same recipe several times and, best of all, take notes of what the difference is between bakes.

' '' . .. / ,; / , / , . •• ,------------------------------------------------------·---· AS A TEENAGER, I WAS LUCKY enoughtogowithmydad to some good restaurants. It was at the Chester Grosvenor that I first saw a bread trolley in a Michelin-starred restaurant. I thought: this is interesting. And I also thought: the bread's okay, but it could be better. At the age of twenty-one, I finished working for my dad and applied for a job at the Chester Grosvenor. It's a city centre hotel in a Grade lllisted, black-and-white timbered building. Beautifully decorated inside, you always feel you are somewhere really special there. As a hotel baker, I learnt a whole new range of skills and recipes. My ingredients were more expensive, I had more time and I could experiment. There were all these dainty little things that you might find in a Paris patisserie - so easy to eat and gorgeous. Before working there, I'd never made Danish pastries or croissants- there was little call for croissants in a high -street bakery in the early eighties; if you wanted to eat croissants, you went to France. The head baker taught me his recipes before he left and I've refined them over the years, partly by working with other French pastry chefs, and partly in order to make them more accessible for the home baker. The main lesson I learnt is that a little effort can make a great difference, whether it's a plate of scones or a refined French tart. Working in high-street bakeries, you'd say, 'That'll do' and get away with it. But in hotels, everything has to be consistent and everything has to look perfect. In a normal bakery, when you make scones, say, they are probably 2-3 inches high- quite lumpy scones- because people want to get value for their money. But in a hotel, that's not the case; they want finesse. One of the keys to a smart afternoon tea is keeping everything the same size. That was always critical- from the sandwiches to FIVE-STAR BAKING 112 I the scone to the petits fours, barquettes and meringues. Quality and presentation matter. Scones are easy to make so it's what you serve them with - good jam, butter, cream and tea- that sets a scone apart. The standards in a hotel kitchen are rigorous. Each day, the executive chef would get the least successful breakfast dishes put onto a plate and brought into his office. If anything wasn't good enough, he'd call me in, as head baker. I'd be criticised if a roll was a touch more tanned or if a Danish pastry was slightly raw. It tended to happen because some of the ovens weren't the best, but everything had to be perfect and you couldn't just blame your tools. At the Grosvenor, I nearly gave up my baking career. I said to the chef, 'I'm alright at baking but I've been doing it for years and I want to be a chef.' So he moved me into hors d'oeuvres, then veg, then sauces, and finally mise en place, where you plate up the food. I did that for many months, moving around the kitchen and learning from the chefs and sous-chefs. I learnt to butcher the meat, to gut and prepare a fish. The chef wanted to make the most of my baking skills, so I ended up doing two jobs for a while and working a twelve-hour day. Finally, I said, 'I want to give up the baking and become a full-time chef.' Then he told me the salary. No chance. I went back to full-time baking. However, the experience of working as a cheffor a while gave my baking another dimension. I learnt knife skills that helped me to prepare ingredients for breads and pastries, and it really opened up the world offood, introducing me to flavours and textures I had never encountered before. I would find myself thinking that I could use this or that ingredient in a loaf or on top of a cake, and that became part of my craft. Cooking and baking are different skills but there's a crossover between them that helps a baker to be more creative. FIVE-STAR BAKING 113 ~-------- -- --- -- - - -- -- Next came London. At the age of twenty-four, I became the youngest head baker the Dorchester Hotel had ever had. It's one of the most prestigious five-star hotels in the world, in the centre ofLondon by Hyde Park, and guests come from all over the world to enjoy its thirties' glamour. The staff had a separate entrance down Deanery Street. You'd scan your card and go down to a beautiful kitchen the size of five tennis courts, with the latest equipment, and all of us in brand new uniforms. I'd work ten days and have only two or three days off. I couldn't go back home all that much and I missed my friends and family. In the end I thought: 'London's not for me.' I went up North again, to work at the Chester Grosvenor for another two years. The final chapter in my hotel years came when I worked at Cliveden. This was after I'd been working abroad in Cyprus for six years and it was a return that took me to the heart of the English countryside. You'd swear you were in the middle of nowhere but in fact you are only half an hour's drive from London. As you turn into this gravel drive you see one of the most beautiful stately homes in the country; it's been in many, many films. Ittakes a good five minutes to get to the top of the drive, and when you step into the hotel's grand hallway you'll be greeted by a suit of armour, tapestries on the walls and a huge formal staircase. But the thing I love about Cliveden is that it's still like being in someone's home, and you feel as though you should be there. There was a big snooker room down in the cellar, next to the bakery. I'd go in there when I was in between bakes, or when things were proving, and my snooker improved vastly. The place was beautiful but I have to say that it was also quite creepy at night when I was up baking and everyone else was asleep- I probably looked like a ghost, covered in white flour. Looking back, why did I make the move from the high street to hotel baking? Why did I go for the job ofhead baker at the FIVE-STAR BAKING 115 Dorchester when I reached the age of twenty-four? It's always the challenge. I knew that ifl didn't go for a job, I'd kick myselflater. Stretch yourself, and you become a better baker. Some of the recipes in this chapter are straightforward but have small touches that make them 'five star'. Others are more complex, such as the seasonal Danish pastries on page 118 and the ham and cheese croissants on page 156. These require time and attention but I'd encourage any baker to give them a go. If you can make a bread, you can make a croissant dough. On paper, the recipe seems to go on for ever and ever. But when you break it down, it's not hard. It's really just dough, with layers of butter in between -that's it. Use a good French butter and that will make all the difference. If you choose a high -quality butter and take your time with the folding, you'll end up with something that's up to professional standards. If you push yourself, you'll always find that actually it's not that difficult. Shortcrust pastry is also a matter of practice. It's key to get the fat and sugar to a fine crumb, before adding your egg yolk or water. Once the liquid goes in, mix it together with your hands, pushing and binding it together gently. Don't be tempted to add more liquid, as you'll knead the mixture too much and make it rubbery. Bring the dough together, wrap it in cling film and rest in the fridge for 30 minutes or so. If you make the pastry well ahead, you'll need to let it soften a little at room temperature before using it, or you'll struggle to roll it out without cracking. You can also roll your pastry out between a couple of sheets ofbaking parchment or cling film to stop it sticking to the work surface. If you stretch yourself then you'll always enjoy the rewards. As well as the satisfaction of making something well, you have much more control over what you're eating. Many commercial croissants and pastries use margarine rather than butter as the fat, for example. Bake them yourself and you know what goes into them. That way you'll be eating the best.

To make the creme patissiere, pour the milk into a saucepan. Scrape out the seeds from the vanilla pod and add them to the milk with the empty pod. Slowly bring to the boil. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, beat the egg yolks with the sugar and cornflour. A15 soon as the milk comes to the boil, remove the vanilla pod and pour the milk onto the egg mix, whisking as you do so. Pour back into the pan and heat gently, stirring all the time, until the custard thickens. Pour the creme patissiere into a clean bowl and stir in the butter. Cover the surface closely with cling film to prevent a skin forming and leave to cool, then place in the fridge. Line three baking trays with baking parchment. Unwrap the chilled dough and roll out on a lightly floured surface to a 35cm square. Trim the edges to straighten. Cut the dough into 15 strips, flouring the knife from time to time to stop it sticking.

SESAME-TOPPED BUNS FOR BURGERS MAKES 8 The first burger I ever ate was at a Wimpy, when that restaurant chain was the coolest thing on the planet. Here's my recipe for home-made buns with sesame seeds on top, to make your burger special. I've also given a recipe for the burgers, as making your own means you can use good-quality mince and add extra tasty seasoning. 500g strong white bread fl. our, plus extra for dusting 7gfinesalt 7ginstantdriedyeast 40gunsalted butter, cut into small dice, softened 2 tsp caster sugar About 225rnl whole mi1J< About lOOrnl cold water 50g sesame seeds, for sprinkling Oil, for oiling Put the flour into a large bowl and add the salt to one side and the yeast to the other. Tip in the butter pieces and sugar. Combine the milk and water in a jug, then pour three-quarters into the flour mixture and turn the mixture around with the fingers of one hand to mix. Continue to add the remaining liquid, a little at a time, until all the flour is incorporated. The dough needs to be soft, but not soggy. (You may not need all the liquid or you may need a little more; it depends on the flour.) Tip the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it for 5-10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Place in a lightly oiled bowl, cover and leave to rise for about an hour. Line two baking trays with baking parchment. Tip the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead to knock out any air. Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces and shape each into a smooth ball by placing it in a cage formed by your cupped hand on the work surface and moving your hand around in a circular motion, rotating the ball rapidly. Place on the trays, allowing room to spread. Place each baking tray in a large, clean plastic b<!-g and leave the rolls to prove until doubled in size. This will take about an hour or longer, depending on the temperature. Heat your oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Just before baking, remove the trays from the plastic bags. Brush the tops of the rolls with water and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake for 15 minutes then lower the oven setting to 160°C/Gas 3 and bake for a further 5-10 minutes, until risen and golden brown. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.

The flour goes in first, followed by the salt and yeast. It's important to keep these two ingredients separate- adding them to opposite sides of the bowl - as the sal twill slow down (or even kill) the yeast in its concentrated form. Different flours absorb different amounts of water. Add about three-quarters of the water quantity given in a recipe and mix it into the flour with your hands, adding as much as you need of the rest, or some more. You learn how to feel how much water is needed through experience. For continental breads or sourdough loaves with a more open structure, wetter is better. It is easier to mix very wet doughs, such as baguette dough, in a food mixer. You then tip the whole dough out onto a work surface. If it's a dough with butter in it, I'd use a little dusting of flour. For other doughs, I began to advise oiling the work surface because so many people were coming up to me and saying that their bread was tight, with small holes and a poor rise. This can partly be down to putting too much flour on the work surface as you knead. By oiling the surface instead, you keep the dough soft, it doesn't stick so much and, crucially, you don't get any more flour going in. There is no hard-and-fast rule for kneading bread. Some people slap a wet dough on the work surface, some people stretch it. I tend to constantly roll, roll, stretch, stretch. Each of these techniques builds up the gluten that makes the bread rise and hold its shape. Everyone has a way that works for them. You then need to let the dough rise. Slower is better as it means more flavour. That's why I recommend using cold rather than warm water and leaving the dough in a cool place - even the fridge sometimes- so that the yeast works less quickly. Some of the doughs in this chapter use relatively little yeast, which also promotes a slow rise. After the initial rise, you need to knock back and shape the dough. Knocking back gets rid of the air pockets and creates BEGINNER'S BREAD 66 a uniform texture so the dough rises evenly. To do this and to shape the dough, for most breads you just fold and fold. It's a bit like folding paper: the dough becomes stronger, and the finished loafis more able to hold its shape. This is especially important for breads you make without a tin. For baguettes, I let the dough rise in a square or rectangular tub that's not too deep- an old ice-cream tub works well- so you can tip the dough onto the work surface without losing too much air. You then knock it back less, and shape the loaf more carefully. Next comes the final rise, or proving. Give dough plenty of time to prove. Again, you learn by touch when a loaf is ready to go in the oven: it should spring back when gently pressed with a finger. You want to catch the dough when it is at the top of its rise, before the yeast is exhausted and the dough stops rising and starts to slacken. For novices, I'd recommend starting with soda bread, without a shadow of a doubt. It's simple and doesn't need proving at all. Kids won't be bored and it'll take 45 minutes from the time you start to the time you bring it out of the oven. The next stage is making bread in a tin. There's only one way that a tin bread can rise, and that's up. Then make rolls and build up to bigger cobs. Finally you can get on to sourdough, which is more complex and harder to handle but worth the effort; for some it's really the ultimate bread. Once you've finished your loaf and it's come out of the oven, the killer is leaving it to cool when all you want to do is eat it. Leave it on your wire rack, admire it, photograph it, Instagram it, Tweet it, tell all your friends. Then you slice it. The time you really want your own loaf is in the morning when you wake up and remember that you've got that bread downstairs that you made yesterday. Stick a slice in the toaster. Butter, jam or marmalade, mug of tea, first bite: that's when you realise your life has changed forever.

Once the butter has melted, add the onions and stir to coat. Cook slowly over a low heat, stirring occasionally, for about 20 minutes until the onions are softened. Add the sugar, thyme and a pinch of salt. Continue to cook until the onions turn golden brown, stirring occasionally to stop them burning. Tip onto a plate and leave to cool. Heat your oven to 200°C/Gas 6 and line a large baking tray with baking parchment. Put both flours into a large bowl with the salt and bicarbonate of soda and mix well. Make a well in the centre and add the caramelised onions and half the buttermilk. Use the fingers of one hand (or a round-bladed knife and then your fingers) to draw the flour into the buttermilk. Continue to add the buttermilk until all the flour has been incorporated and you have a sticky, malleable dough. You may not need all the buttermilk (depending on the flour- different brands absorb slightly more or less liquid). Tip the dough onto a floured surface, shape into a ball and flatten slightly. Place on the prepared baking tray. Use a large sharp knife to mark the loaf into quarters, cutting deeply into the dough but not quite through the base. Dust the top of the loaf with flour. Bake for 30-35 minutes until the loaf is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the base. You can carefully cut along one of the seams to see if the inside is cooked through; if not, put the loafback in the oven for 5 minutes or so. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely.

This brioche is shaped so it has a tete, or head. One of the difficulties is to keep this bobble balanced. The trick is not to make the top part too heavy or it will crush the lower one. There's also a special technique in this recipe for joining the two balls together in a way that keeps the tete right on top.

Add the butter pieces and continue to mix for a further 4-5 minutes, scraping down the bowl periodically to ensure that the butter is fully incorporated. The dough will be very soft. Tip the dough into a plastic bowl, cover with cling film and chill for at least 7 hours, or overnight, until it has firmed up and you are able to shape it. Grease a 22cm brioche tin with butter. Take the brioche dough from the fridge. Tip it onto a lightly floured surface and fold it in on itself a few times to knock out the air. Tear off a piece of the dough (about 125g in weight) and shape it into a smooth ball by placing it in a cage formed by your cupped hand on the work surface and moving your hand around in a circular motion, rotating the ball rapidly.

Using a knife, slice the bottom half of the tapered end vertically in two, keeping the top half intact. Pull the two ends apart then insert these tapered ends through the hole in the large ball and tuck them outwards underneath the large ball. Form the top of the cylinder into a ball. (This technique keeps the small ball of dough in place when it's baked, otherwise it can tip to the side and won't stay in the middle.) Push the handle of a wooden spoon down through both balls right to the base. This will help the brioche to cook all the way through.

Make sure you chill the dough well and roll it out to exactly the same level each time so you don't get more butter in some parts and end up with bread rather than a properly flaky croissant.

Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to a rectangle, 60 x 20cm, to end up with a short side facing you. The dough can be quite hard to stretch because it wants to pull back into shape; one tip is to press the sides down onto the work surface to help hold the dough as you roll. Spread the butter out to cover the bottom two-thirds of the dough; make sure it is in an even layer and comes almost to the edges. Fold the exposed dough down to cover half of the butter. Fold the bottom half of the buttered dough up and over, then seal the dough by gently squeezing the edges together.

After the final tum, wrap the dough in cling film and chill for at least 8 hours, or overnight, to rest and rise slightly. When you are ready to shape the croissants, line two or three baking trays with baking parchment. Place the chilled dough on a lightly floured surface and roll into a rectangle, 42 x 30cm, with a short side facing you. Trim the edges to neaten. Cut the rectangle in two lengthways, then cut triangles along the length of each strip (a pizza wheelis a good tool for this job). The base of each triangle should be about 12cm wide and it should be about15cm high. You will get 6 triangles from each strip (you'll need to trim off a small triangular piece from each end). Cut the ham into pieces that are roughly the same size as the dough triangles. Place a piece of ham on each triangle and sprinkle over some grated cheese. Hold the wide base of the triangle and gently tug the pointed opposite end to cause slight tension in the dough. Starting at the thick end, roll up into a croissant shape. Place the croissants on the prepared trays, leaving space in between for them to expand. Place each tray in a large, clean plastic bag and leave to prove at room temperature for 2 hours, or until the croissants have doubled in size.

Mix 250g of the royal icing sugar with 3 tbsp water to make a thick pipeable icing and put into a piping bag fitted with a writing nozzle. Pipe the decoration of your choice onto the walls. Pipe parallellines of icing on the roof and stick on the chocolate buttons, overlapping them slightly to resemble tiles. You can also pipe semi -circles of icing on each button for extra 'snow'. Leave the walls and roof to set for at least 10 hours, or overnight. To assemble the house, have your cake board ready. Heat the apricot jam with a little water, then brush over the cake board.

Attach the front door with icing. Leave to set for at least 10 hours or overnight before attaching the roof, storing the spare icing in an airtight container. You can attach both roof pieces at once but it is easier to do this in two stages, leaving time for setting in between. Pipe a generous amount of icing on the top edge of one side wall and the front and back gable on the same side of the house. Use icing to attach a Flake to the top inside of that side wall to act as a support. Pipe icing on the edge of one roof piece and attach it to the house.

BASIC MADEIRA CAKE MAKES 40 - 60 SLICES (ONCE ICED) Madeira has more of a chew than a Victoria sandwich sponge and is the best cake to use as the basis for a celebration cake. Cakes for special occasions are often decorated beautifully but the cake inside can often be disappointing. This recipe delivers every time. When making large cakes it is much easier to use a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, if you have one. The following recipe is used to make the two tiered celebration cakes on the pages that follow. For the 15cm cake 165g self-raising flour llOg caster sugar llOg soft tub margarine, plus extra for greasing 2 medium eggs ltbspmilk For the 23cm cake 450g self-raising flour 400g caster sugar 400g soft tub margarine, plus extra for greasing 7 medium eggs 3tbspmilk Heat your oven to 150°C/ Gas 2. Grease the base and sides of a 15cm and a 23cm deep loose-based cake tin and line the base and sides ofboth tins with baking parchment. Put all the ingredients for the 15cm cake in a food mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and start mixing on the lowest speed to combine the ingredients. Then increase the speed and mix for about 1 minute until the mixture is smooth and pale in colour. Pour into the lined tin and smooth the top to level. Use the same method to prepare the larger cake. You can cook the cakes together, ideally on the same shelf in the centre of the oven. Allow about 1 hour for the smaller cake, about 1% hours for the larger cake; do not open the door to check the smaller cake before 55 minutes. The cakes should be risen, lightly golden and spring back when pressed gently. To test, insert a skewer into the centre of the cake: it should come out clean. If not, continue baking for a further 5-10 minutes. When each cake is ready, remove from the oven and leave to cool in the tin for 5 minutes, then turn out and place on a wire rack. Leave to cool completely. CELEBRATIONS 281 CLASSIC ICED CELEBRATION CAKE MAKES ABOUT 60 SLICES This simple, elegant cake is ideal for a wedding, christening or other celebration. For a professional finish, invest in a few items of equipment from a specialist cake supplier - a turntable, a plastic scraper, an icing smoother and a straight-edge rule. You'll also need a non -stick rolling pin, small piping bags and 2mm and 3mm piping nozzles (i.e. sizes 3 and 5). As for timing, if the celebration is on a Saturday, bake the cake on the Monday, marzipan it on the Tuesday and royal ice on the Wednesday. Apply the sugar paste on the Thursday and pipe the finishing touches on the Friday. Position any fresh flowers at the last minute. 1 x 15cm Madeira cake 1 x 23cm Madeira cake (see page 281) For the royal icing 50ml cold water 2 tsp dried egg white powder 260g icing sugar (regular not royal), sifted For the buttercream 250gunsalted butter, softened 400g sifted icing sugar (regular, not royal) About 1 tbsp rose water, to taste To assemble and decorate 1.5kg natural marzipan 1.75kg sugar paste or ready-to-roll icing (in your chosen colour) Gel food colouring (in your chosen colour) Fresh flowers (optional) To make the royal icing, put the water into a bowl, add the egg white powder and whisk until dissolved to form to a milky, lump-free liquid. (Using powdered instead ofliquid egg white gives the icing lightness.) Pour the egg white liquid into a food mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and add half the icing sugar. Mix on a slow speed to combine and then add the remaining icing sugar, a spoonful at a time, until you have the consistency of soft whipped cream. Increase the speed to medium and beat until the mixture doubles in volume and turns glossy; this will take about 5 minutes. Now beat on the fastest setting for 2 minutes until the icing is fluffy. Transfer to a bowl, cover with a clean damp cloth and set aside until ready to use. To make the buttercream, beat the butter using a hand-held electric whisk until very soft. Gradually add the icing sugar, mixing on a slow speed until it is all incorporated. Then increase the speed and beat until fluffy and paler in colour. The buttercream needs to be quite stiff otherwise the cake layers will move. Flavour with rose water, to taste. To assemble, place the cakes on a work surface and, using a large serrated knife, carefully trim off the top of each so they are level. Cut each cake in halfhorizontally, using the knife.

If any air bubbles appear on the surface, prick them with a needle then rub over with the smoother. Wipe the top and sides of the cake with a clean damp cloth to barely dampen the surface of the royal icing (this will enable the sugar paste to stick). Dry your hands then lift the sugar paste and position over the cake. Starting on top, smooth out the icing then gently ease it down and around the side of the cake, using the palms of your hands to smooth it as you go. Trim the excess paste from the bottom edge of the cake. Take your smoother and quickly but gently buff the top and sides of the cake, going back and forth (just as you would buff shoes). This will give straight sides and ease out any blemishes in the sugar paste. Trim the bottom edge as neatly and as close to the cake as possible. Cover the smaller cake with sugar paste in the same way, using 500g sugar paste and rolling it outto a 32cm circle. Leave to set overnight. TO ASSEMBLE AND FINISH Take the sugar-paste covered drum board, spread a little royal icing on the centre and lift the large cake (off its board) on to this covered drum board. Spread a little royal icing on top of the large cake and position the small cake (on its card) on top. Place on the turntable. Spread the remaining royal icing on a work surface or board to remove any air bubbles and make it smooth. Add a little colouring and stir in using a cocktail stick until it is a similar shade to the sugar paste. Put some of the coloured icing into a small piping bag fitted with a 2mm (size 3) nozzle, being careful not to overload it as this makes it harder to control. Pipe two rows of small balls onto the icing around the side of the smaller cake. To do this, place the nozzle on the cake and squeeze the bag to form the ball, then stop squeezing and twist the bag away from the cake. You may find there is a peak on the ball. To remove this use a fine, damp paintbrush to wipe away. Put some more coloured icing into a small piping bag fitted with a 3mm (size 5) nozzle. Angle the bag and pipe a row ofballs where the small cake meets the large cake in order to cover the join. Attach rib bon around the base of the cake, using a little icing (overlap the ends slightly). Attach ribbon around the edge of the drum board using double-sided tape.

(Or you can manage with one of each sized tin, re-greasing and lining to bake the half-size cakes.) For each of the full-size cakes and the half-size 23cm cake, it is best to use a food mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Place all the ingredients for the particular cake in the mixer and start mixing on the lowest speed to combine. Then increase the speed and mix for about 1 minute until the mixture is smooth and pale in colour. Pour into the lined tin and smooth the top to level. For the half-size 15cm cake, place all the ingredients in a large bowl and mix together with a hand-held electric whisk, until smooth and combined. Pour into the lined tin and smooth the surface to level. You can cook two cakes at the same time, ideally on the same shelf in the centre of the oven, but don't open the oven until near the end of the cooking time for the smaller one.

The cakes should be risen, light golden and spring back when pressed gently. To test, insert a skewer into the centre: it should come out clean; if it doesn't, bake for a further 5-10 minutes.

Transfer to a bowl and cover with a damp cloth. Trim all the cakes level, using a serrated knife, then cut both deep cakes in halfhorizontally. To assemble, spread a layer of jam on the bottom half of the deep 23cm cake and sandwich together with the other half, pressing the top down firmly.

Use a dry pastry brush to remove any excess crumbs from the cakes. Place the 23cm cake on the turntable. Place a quarter of the meringue on top of the cake and spread it out using a palette knife, working from the centre outwards. Don't worry if the meringue goes down the sides. Try not to touch the cake with your palette knife, only the meringue. Load one side of the palette knife with more meringue and gently ease in sections over the side of the cake until all of it is covered, icing the section of the cake in front of you and rotating the turntable as you go. Take your plastic scraper and use it to remove excess meringue from the side to give the cake an irregular finish; you should be able to see the sponge in places. Repeat this with the smaller cake, making sure you cover the edges where the cake meets the card. Use a palette knife to lift the cake and remove the loose cake base.

This brioche is shaped so it has a tete, or head. One of the difficulties is to keep this bobble balanced. The trick is not to make the top part too heavy or it will crush the lower one. There's also a special technique in this recipe for joining the two balls together in a way that keeps the tete right on top.

Add the butter pieces and continue to mix for a further 4-5 minutes, scraping down the bowl periodically to ensure that the butter is fully incorporated. The dough will be very soft. Tip the dough into a plastic bowl, cover with cling film and chill for at least 7 hours, or overnight, until it has firmed up and you are able to shape it. Grease a 22cm brioche tin with butter. Take the brioche dough from the fridge. Tip it onto a lightly floured surface and fold it in on itself a few times to knock out the air. Tear off a piece of the dough (about 125g in weight) and shape it into a smooth ball by placing it in a cage formed by your cupped hand on the work surface and moving your hand around in a circular motion, rotating the ball rapidly.

Using a knife, slice the bottom half of the tapered end vertically in two, keeping the top half intact. Pull the two ends apart then insert these tapered ends through the hole in the large ball and tuck them outwards underneath the large ball. Form the top of the cylinder into a ball. (This technique keeps the small ball of dough in place when it's baked, otherwise it can tip to the side and won't stay in the middle.)

In recent years, the range of ingredients available in this country has exploded, making exotic recipes much more accessible. Most of what you need can be found in supermarkets and delis, or else is easily available online. My travels in baking really began in my late twenties, when I was approached about working as a head baker for a hotel in Cyprus. The guests at the time were mainly from Europe and the hotel needed someone to show the Cypriot guys how European baking worked. Most bakers who went out there stayed six months. I fell in love with the place and stayed for six years. Going to Cyprus was a massive change from life in the north ofEngland. It was very hot in the bakery so we just wore shorts. I got on with the lifestyle and the people, and I made a lot of new friends. Most importantly, I met my wife Alex out there- she was working in the hotel- and we got married in the oldest Christian church on the island. The hotel where I worked is called the Annabelle and it's like something out of a dream: swimming pools, the view of the sea, the heat. Even in winter, it's 25°C when the sun's out. I soon started to pick up the Cypriot way ofbaking. They still make bread at home in the beehive ovens you see all over the island; every family has one in the garden. They're like the outdoor ovens you find in Italy, with an arched opening and a domed interior. They fire the oven up with loads of wood and once the brick starts turning white, you push the wood and ash to one side, mop it out, get a big bunch of oregano tied to a stick and brush the inside of the oven, so the herbs infuse the oven and all your breads. Cypriot families get together on a Sunday- the teenagers, the grandparents, everyone. They might work in the city but BAKES OF THE WORLD 162 I t • I • I • at the weekend they go back to their village to see their yay as - grandmothers- and their mothers. It's all about food, and bread baked in the oven is the centre of that. Like olives, halloumi and feta, it's a celebration of their area. Cyprus has got a Greek aspect, obviously, but it also has a great influence from the Middle East. When I lived in Cyprus, it wasn't part of the EU and I had to leave the country every six months to go and get a stamp on my visa, so I did a lot of travelling in the Middle East, finding out about different ways ofbaking. First I travelled to Jordan to check out their flatbreads. I remember going to the walled city of Petra and coming across a Bedouin woman squatting down on the ground next to a fire, making breads on a small metal dome. As she demonstrated how to make bread in this very basic way I realised that, essentially, nothing in this method had changed for thousands of years. Then I went to Egypt, and there I was fascinated by the tarts and puddings made with set milk or cream. They've often got mastika, or mastic, in there. This is a dried tree resin with the aniseed flavour that runs through many of the bakes in the Middle East, and also Cyprus, and it is one of the more unusual ingredients that I've included in this chapter. The ovens were similar to the ones in Cyprus, except a bit more square and longer, in order to get more into them. Being abroad is about digging around to discover why people eat what they do. In the Middle East, how do you bake when the temperatures are so extreme? You have to adapt your recipes to make them work. What flours do they have? The soils of the Middle East mean the flour is less strong- with less protein to make it rise- and so they make flatbreads . Because many people in the Middle East used to be nomadic, they didn't stay in one place for long enough to build an oven, and kept the bread-making pretty simple. When they did build ovens, they were more like furnaces than our Western ovens. BAKES OF THE WORLD 163 It's all about getting very high temperatures when it comes to flatbreads -the thinner the bread, the faster you want to cook it to stop it drying out. When I travel, I try flavours, I try techniques. I think about the bakes people ate historically and then see how that leads up to what they eat today. There are the differences between countries, and then there are the connections. Just look at the variations on the same ingredients: you think of fruit cake and hot cross buns in Britain but you also find fruited buns and loaves in Italy, France, Norway, Sweden. The methods have changed slightly but the basic recipe is instantly recognisable. Some of these connections go way back. Archaeologists have found sourdough spores in the large ceramic pots they used for bread-making in Ancient Egypt; this style ofbaking, so popular again these days, has long roots. Back in this country, London is one of the world's most important centres offood, thanks to the city's diversity and the huge number of chefs. It's a melting pot offood cultures and top-quality cooking- from Mexican to Indian to Middle Eastern. You can take all these flavour combinations into baking, both savoury and sweet. You can also learn different techniques, though they're not always easy. I once had a go at cooking naan bread in a tandoor in an Indian restaurant and nearly scalded my eyebrows off it was so hot! When I went to work in the Mediterranean, I fell in love with baking all over again. I still travel and bake today. You always discover another approach to food in other countries and different slants on the familiar- flavours, methods, proving, baking. It keeps you learning.

Slide the pizza into the oven, placing it 10cm or so from the grill. Cook for 4-5 minutes, until the topping is bubbling; watch closely to ensure the crust doesn't burn. Repeat the process to cook the other pizza. Just before serving, sprinkle with the grated lemon zest and thyme sprigs.

BAKES OF THE WORLD 204 A RETURN TO BRITISH BAKING TELEVISION IS A DIFFERENT WAY ofteaching.Peopleliketo be entertained as they learn- you know that from back at school and the teachers who made you want to listen. I want viewers to get little nuggets that they can take back to the kitchen and use. When I came back to live in Britain in 1999, I started to run my own bakeries and at the same time began to appear on Tv. I'm not quite sure why but being in front of a camera came naturally. The advice is always to be yourself. I'm not an actor so it was straightforward to do just that. It was 2010 when I got a call from Love Productions telling me about a new programme they were making. Would I be interested in auditioning? Someone from the production team came to my house, tipped out a bag ofbakes and said: judge them. Then I met my fellow presenters and it all fell into place. You cannot fake chemistry; it happens from day one. The programme really started to take shape in the first series. In the original Bake Offline up, Mary was everyone's grandma, including mine. She was from the tradition ofhome baking. I was used to dealing in 20kg of flour for making batches ofbread, while Mary thinks in grams. She was the comforting arm around the shoulder while I was more the teacher who said, 'I think you should do this, see me afterwards.' My job was to be a straight, honest and fair judge. You have to give constructive criticism so the contestants learn. Bake Off is ajourney for them, just as baking has been for me in my own life. Mel and Sue were the gel between us all who kept us sane. They lightened the mood and everyone was happier for it. But Bake Off is not about the hosts and the judges, it's about the bakers- they are the stars of the show. It's important for them to manage their time properly in order to succeed- and the same thing is true in a professional bakery. A bakery has to be working at all levels, immediately, because if your ovens are SHOWSTOPPING PIES, PUDS & CAKES 208 .. l I \" on and not being used, you're wasting money. So you plan your time carefully. That's also true at home, when you want to be efficient as you bake, and make the most of your time. The bakers need two other qualities to do well: technique and artistic flair. Most have a bit of one aspect, and a lot of the other. Some might be talented and artistic, but have more style than substance. The skill is to marry the two together. When you get both, it's magical. The ones who do well in the competition tend to develop over time. And sometimes they're lucky, because another baker just happens to have done worse that day. The challenges we set for contestants show off and test their skills, and encourage people at home to bake. The Showstopper is the 'wow factor'. It's most often a highly decorated bake and this is where a baker's creativity shines through. What viewers get from this is ideas - how to create three-tiered cakes, how to make something look good. Some of the recipes in this chapter, such as the Swiss roll and the roulade, are more of a technical challenge that you can learn and then adapt to your own tastes. I've also given recipes for some of my favourite pies, a British tradition that we feature in the programme. Then there are the recipes that take technique to perfect, such as a mirror glaze on a cake. And there are some impressive pudding recipes, including souflles, that aren't that difficult to make once you've learnt a few tricks. People watching an elaborate cake being prepared may think, 'I don't think I could make that.' But there are also ways to make a bake special with the minimum amount of work and fuss. Part of this is flavour. But be careful - stick with flavours that you like and know work well together. There are lots of trendy and strange tastes out there. In reality you'll probably prefer coconut, banana, strawberry to Earl Grey or lavender. If you're dealing with flavours such as lavender, rosemary or rose then be sparing. Don't go crazy because the taste will kill everything. SHOWSTOPPING PIES, PUDS & CAKES 209 When I first started doing television, baking was seen as niche. But Bake Offhas had far more people watching it than any other cookery show. Sales ofbakeware, food mixers and different kinds of flours have soared and I can even see its impact in my day-to-day life. Everybody and anybody asks me about baking: 'My bread's too tight'; 'My cake's dropped in the middle'; 'How do I make a decent souffle?' The questions I get asked are many and varied. Builders shout out to me at the traffic lights- 'I burnt me cakes, mate, what am I doing wrong?' I get grandmas and kids coming up to me in supermarkets about their brownies. Why is this? It's because we're a nation ofbakers and we'd forgotten about that. We went through twenty years ofbuying stuff rather than making it. Now we've come back to making again. Some of the bakes in mainland Europe are complicated, but in this country we have some great basic bakes with good flavours. We've got a plethora of ingredients from all over the world to use. We've got some of the best flours. We've also got great bakers. No wonder people want to bake and learn more than ever before.

Meanwhile, pour the warm custard into warmed serving bowls and sit a meringue in each portion. As soon as the caramel is ready, drizzle it over the meringues using a metal spoon, working quickly so the caramel doesn't set in the pan. Serve at once.

CHOCOLATE & SALTED CARAMEL MACARONS MAKES 30 It's a technical challenge to get perfect macarons but they'll taste good even. if they don't look immaculate. The key, as with so many bakes, is to be patient. Leave the piped macarons to rest so that a slight skin forms on the top. You then bake them off, pipe your filling on the base and sandwich them together. For the chocolate paste 3large eggwhites 240g ground almonds 240g icing sugar 40g cocoa powder For the meringue 3large egg whites 240g caster sugar 1 tbsp finely chopped cocoa nibs, to finish For the salted caramel filling 150g granulated sugar 90ml double cream Y. tsp fine sea salt 30g unsalted butter Line three baking trays with baking parchment. Using a 4.5cm cutter as a guide, draw circles on the paper, leaving 2cm space in between them. Turn the paper over and place on the baking tray (so you can see the circles but the lines won't mark the macarons ). To make the chocolate paste, put the egg whites into a bowl with the ground almonds, then sift over the icing sugar and cocoa powder. Mix together to form a thick paste. To make the meringue, put the egg whites and sugar into aheatproof bowl and set over a pan of simmering water (making sure the water is not touching the bowl). Using a balloon whisk, beat the mixture thoroughly until the sugar dissolves and the mixture reaches a temperature of 65°C (as registered on a cook's thermometer). . Remove the bowl from the heat. Either transfer the mixture to'a food mixer fitted with the whisk attachment or use a hand-held electric whisk to whisk until cooled and you have a stiff, glossy meringue; this will take at least 5 minutes. -~- ,- I\" . - Gradually fold the meringue into the chocolate paste, a spoonful at a time. The mixture is stiff so this will take some effort. Spoon the mixture into a piping bag fitted with a lcm nozzle, or snip the end off a paper piping bag to create an aperture of this size. Pipe the 'mixture evenly within the marked circles on the parchment. Sprinkle half of them with the chopped cocoa nibs. Leave the macarons to stand, uncovered, for at least 30 minutes, or until a skin forms. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 150°C/Gas 2. Bake the macarons for 15 minutes, until risen and set. Leave to cool completely on the baking trays before assembling. To make the caramel, place the sugar in a small heavy-based saucepan or frying pan. Over a low heat and without stirring, gently melt the sugar until it turns a golden caramel colour. AB soon as it has ch~ged colour, slowly pour in the cream and stir, protecting your hand with an oven glove as the mixture will bubble ferociously. Keep stirring until.the cream is incorporated, then add the salt and butter. Remove the pan from the heat and st~r vigorously with a woocten spoon until the butter has melted. Leave to cool in the pan. To assemble, transfer the caramel to a small paper piping bag and snip off the end. Pipe a little salted caramel onto the plain macaron bases, leaving a clear margin around the edge. Sandwich together with the cocoa-nib-topped macarons and place ofi a serving plate . MATCHA MIRROR GLAZE GATEAU SERVES 8 Matcha, a special Japanese powdered green tea, gives this sponge a modern flavour and brilliant colour; you can find it in health food shops. Once mastered, a mirror glaze turns a home-made cake into something beautiful. It's all about the shine and you have to be careful to get rid of all the crumbs, as every little bump will show.

Any imperfections will show up once the mirror glaze is applied so take your time over this - turn the cake around as you spread the cream with the edge of the palette knife or a scraper and wipe the blade with a clean, damp cloth to keep it free of crumbs. Place the cake in the fridge for 30 minutes to chill and firm up the cream. (You want the cream to be set firm but not too cold or the mirror glaze might crack.) To make the mirror glaze, soak the gelatine leaves in a shallow dish of cold water to soften for a few minutes. Chop the white chocolate into small pieces and place three-quarters in a medium bowl. Put the water, sugar and condensed milk in a saucepan and heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar has dissolved. Squeeze the excess water from the gelatine sheets then add them to the pan and immediately remove from the heat. Stir until the gelatine has dissolved. Pour the gelatine mixture onto the chocolate and whisk until the chocolate has melted. Add the remaining chocolate and stir to melt. Strain through a fine sieve into a jug (this helps to remove any air bubbles). Leave the glaze to cool until it is almost the consistency of condensed milk but still pourable (at about 25-27°C, but the exact temperature varies according to the brand of chocolate). To cool the mixture quickly, place the bowl in a larger bowl filled with iced water. Sit the cake on its board on a wire rack with a tray placed underneath.

These always include a bake. Birthdays mean birthday cake, with everyone sitting round and the candles to blow out. I've made many cakes for my lad Josh growing up. He likes chocolate cake and some years it is covered in his favourite sweets. I make sure the cake is good, make a lovely ganache and cover it in Milky Bars or whatever he wants. It's fine to go out and buy a novelty cake, but a cake made by family or friends is always best. Or take Easter. It makes me think of hot cross buns and Simnel cake. I love the marzipan on a Simnel cake, but in some ways it's the tradition of making that cake at that time which matters. Then there's Christmas cake. I like heavily fruited cakes with the crunch of royal icing, even though I'm full after dinner. The story of a wedding cake goes back hundreds of years. When Queen Victoria married Albert, they had a big tiered cake covered in white icing and that is when it became known as 'royal icing'. Such special cakes have always been about showing off skills and, most of all, sharing. If you can get people around a table with a bake central to that- a bread, a cake or pastries, it's a way of communicating, enjoying what you eat and share. Celebration cakes and bakes are often nostalgic because they are rooted in tradition and that's something we're very good at in this country. We have a long history ofbaking that has been passed down generation to generation. Every family has a go-to cake and with a bit of effort, even an everyday bake can be turned into something special- by decorating it and making it personal to you. If you know how to make a simple tea loaf, then you can make a round one and cover it with marzipan; decorate it with icing and put a bride and groom on the top and you'll have a straightforward wedding cake. CELEBRATIONS 252 One of the first cakes that most people ever make is a Victoria sandwich. Mix it together, bung it in a tin and bake it. I like to put cream in the filling- this goes against the rules for some, I know, but cream and cherry jam it is for me. I put the jam in first and pipe cream on top of the jam in concentric circles. I also like to put plenty of icing sugar on top of the cake. You can heat skewers over a gas flame and press them on to burn the icing sugar and make a criss-cross pattern. Or decorate the cake with a pile or rasp berries or cherries, the same flavour as the jam. All such ideas take the cake to another level. Decoration needn't be elaborate. You can make a simple ganache (using a decent amount of chocolate and cream and a little bit ofbutter), pour it on and leave it to set. Melt some white chocolate and spin that over, then fan some strawberries over the top to finish. You've gone from a £5 to a £25 cake, with the minimum of effort and outlay. Always remember that a cake at a celebration can be the main event or the finale at the end of the meal; it's often what you remember, so make it good. People can go overboard when it comes to decoration; I, for one, don't know when to stop. I love manipulating sugar paste. One year, I made a Christmas cake featuring mice in bed. The Christmas cake was the bed and the marzipan was the duvet and then I put sugar paste around the outside. There were twelve mice in the bed and I set the whole cake in a box, painting the walls with chocolate and making chocolate floorboards marked with toothpicks to get little knots. I put a sugar paste rug next to the bed and twelve pairs of slippers. Then I used sugar paste for Father Christmas's footprints to a fireplace, which I'd filled with chocolate sticks. I painted a picture of mice on the walls. There were stockings hanging on the bed post and toys spilling out from them onto the floor, all made with coloured sugar paste. By the time I'd finished, I'd set up a scene that wouldn't be out of place in Wallace and Gromit. CELEBRATIONS 253 Imagination is key. Take inspiration from things you like. If you can model something in Plasticine, you can do it in sugar paste. It's like sculpture- you just have to think in a three- dimensional way. There are lots of templates you can buy these days, or draw your own, copying or tracing over an image to help. I generally recommend baking a Madeira sponge for novelty cakes and large scale celebration cakes- so I've given a recipe in this chapter. It tastes good, is easy to cut and acts as a great base for other flavours and for your decorations. A whisked sponge would concertina down under even a slight amount of weight, but a Madeira will take icing, fruit, whatever you want. It's also important to use ingredients that will keep. Such cakes take time to make and you need to do them in advance of a big occasion, so use buttercream rather than fresh cream, for example. For big occasions, I have created two stunning celebration cakes. Royal icing has fallen from fashion, in terms ofhome baking, but I love this tradition and show you how to ice a cake in this way on pages 286-9, giving the tips of a professional. When you are piping, don't overfill the icing bag. Hold the bag at the top, rolling it down as you go so you don't get air bubbles. Keep the nozzle close to the cake, for more control, and don't push out the icing too fast- work smoothly and steadily. As well as a royal iced cake, I've given a recipe for a naked celebration cake, using a meringue-based icing that is scraped away to reveal part of the cake. The style is informal but the cake is modern and beautiful. The recipes in this chapter are for celebrations with family and friends, when we want to push the boat out. Some are more straightforward, and some are my personal take on classics such as creme brule e. Others, like the gingerbread house, take time. But, of course, you can simplify the decorations if you like; that applies to the other recipes in this chapter too.

You will need to make three paper or card templates: a rectangular side wall (18 x 10cm); arectangularroof(19 x 12cm); and amain wall with a triangular gable top (base 18cm, sides 18cm and then sloping into a triangular gable 29cm from base to apex). You will use these to make two side walls, two roof pieces, a front wall and a back wall. To make the dough, in a large bowl, mix the flour, bicarbonate of soda and spices together. Add the butter and rub in with your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs, then stir in the sugar. In another large bowl, mix the eggs with the golden syrup and treacle. Add the flour mixture and mix to combine and form a soft dough. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead until smooth. Wrap in cling film and refrigerate for at least 1 hour.

Cut out two 4cm square windows from the side walls. Cut an 8 x Scm door and a Scm circular window in the front wall. (Keep the cut-out door.)

Mix 250g of the royal icing sugar with 3 tbsp water to make a thick pipeable icing and put into a piping bag fitted with a writing nozzle. Pipe the decoration of your choice onto the walls. Pipe parallellines of icing on the roof and stick on the chocolate buttons, overlapping them slightly to resemble tiles. You can also pipe semi -circles of icing on each button for extra 'snow'. Leave the walls and roof to set for at least 10 hours, or overnight. To assemble the house, have your cake board ready. Heat the apricot jam with a little water, then brush over the cake board. Cover with the desiccated coconut so it looks like snow. Mix the remaining royal icing sugar and water to a thick paste. Pipe icing on the base and sides of the front wall. Use a mug as a prop and stand the front wall against it so that it remains upright and sticks to the cake board. Pipe icing along the sides and base of the other three walls. Place them firmly on the cake board and join the edges together to make a house, using more icing as needed to fill any gaps. As you go, use icing to stick 3 Flakes on the inside base of the house, against each wall (except the front wall with the door); also stick 4 Flakes upright on the corners to act as supports. Attach the front door with icing. Leave to set for at least 10 hours or overnight before attaching the roof, storing the spare icing in an airtight container. You can attach both roof pieces at once but it is easier to do this in two stages, leaving time for setting in between. Pipe a generous amount of icing on the top edge of one side wall and the front and back gable on the same side of the house. Use icing to attach a Flake to the top inside of that side wall to act as a support. Pipe icing on the edge of one roof piece and attach it to the house. Use a large glass (such as a pint glass) to prop it up until the icing sets. Leave to set for at least 5 hours, ideally overnight; store the spare icing in an airtight container.

BASIC MADEIRA CAKE MAKES 40 - 60 SLICES (ONCE ICED) Madeira has more of a chew than a Victoria sandwich sponge and is the best cake to use as the basis for a celebration cake. Cakes for special occasions are often decorated beautifully but the cake inside can often be disappointing. This recipe delivers every time. When making large cakes it is much easier to use a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, if you have one. The following recipe is used to make the two tiered celebration cakes on the pages that follow. For the 15cm cake 165g self-raising flour llOg caster sugar llOg soft tub margarine, plus extra for greasing 2 medium eggs ltbspmilk For the 23cm cake 450g self-raising flour 400g caster sugar 400g soft tub margarine, plus extra for greasing 7 medium eggs 3tbspmilk Heat your oven to 150°C/ Gas 2. Grease the base and sides of a 15cm and a 23cm deep loose-based cake tin and line the base and sides ofboth tins with baking parchment. Put all the ingredients for the 15cm cake in a food mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and start mixing on the lowest speed to combine the ingredients. Then increase the speed and mix for about 1 minute until the mixture is smooth and pale in colour. Pour into the lined tin and smooth the top to level. Use the same method to prepare the larger cake. You can cook the cakes together, ideally on the same shelf in the centre of the oven. Allow about 1 hour for the smaller cake, about 1% hours for the larger cake; do not open the door to check the smaller cake before 55 minutes. The cakes should be risen, lightly golden and spring back when pressed gently. To test, insert a skewer into the centre of the cake: it should come out clean. If not, continue baking for a further 5-10 minutes. When each cake is ready, remove from the oven and leave to cool in the tin for 5 minutes, then turn out and place on a wire rack. Leave to cool completely.

(Using powdered instead ofliquid egg white gives the icing lightness.) Pour the egg white liquid into a food mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and add half the icing sugar. Mix on a slow speed to combine and then add the remaining icing sugar, a spoonful at a time, until you have the consistency of soft whipped cream.

Transfer to a bowl, cover with a clean damp cloth and set aside until ready to use. To make the buttercream, beat the butter using a hand-held electric whisk until very soft. Gradually add the icing sugar, mixing on a slow speed until it is all incorporated. Then increase the speed and beat until fluffy and paler in colour. The buttercream needs to be quite stiff otherwise the cake layers will move. Flavour with rose water, to taste.

FIVE DECADES OF BAKING - -·--- - --------, All my life, I have been surrounded by great baking. I've been in the industry for more than thirty years, and yet every day I learn something new. My childhood was in Merseyside and I grew up eating my mum's bakes at home- her ginger biscuits are legendary- and I was always in and out of my dad's bakeries. Following in his footsteps, I did an apprenticeship in high-street bakeries, then began working in five-star hotels. I moved to Cyprus in my late twenties, living and baking there for six years, as well as travelling around the Mediterranean and Middle East, learning about many different styles ofbread and pastry. Coming back to Britain, I set up my own bakeries and I also started to teach baking on television shows. Then one day I got a call asking me to audition as a presenter for a new programme: The Great British Bake Off So started a whole new chapter in my life. Through television, books and other forms of teaching, I'm proud to have been part of a revival of baking in Britain, and the celebration of one of our great national traditions. You don't have to go to college to make a career in baking. I learnt on the job; from reading and by watching other people, but most of all from doing. I've taught perhaps forty people how to bake professionally over the years, some of them from scratch. What matters most, whether amateur or professional, is hands- on experience and the ability and willingness to pick things up. What other qualities help? If you're making puff pastry, croissants, creme pat, bread or any number of other things, you need patience. And to be patient, you need passion. Because even if you fail, you'll do it again and again until you get it right; once you've got it right, you'll never forget. 8 The other key lesson is the importance of touch. Ifl go into a bakery, I can put my finger in a dough and tell you how that bread will come out of the oven- how it'll bake, how it'll look, what the crust is going to be like. That's purely the result of experience, which anyone can build up day by day. Get the knowledge in your fingertips. My dad always encouraged me to use my hands, and I've passed that on to everyone who's ever worked with me. Do something by hand, however much it seems like hard work, and you'll get to know the texture of what you're making. This goes for fillings and decoration too. A lot of people over-whip cream. If you use an electric whisk, you should always under-whip and then take it to the right consistency by hand, lifting the whisk up to see when it's ready. Cooks go by their own taste buds, altering recipes to suit their preferences- putting a little bit more in, tasting as they go. Baking is a different sort of skill. Bakers are scientific. You can play with the flavours in a bake but there's an underlying strategy and science. You have to do things precisely, weighing up the ingredients and getting the timing right. It's all about the chemistry, such as the rising agent's reaction to liquid, and how the salt and fat work with the flour and yeast. Fermentation is key - the way that a dough's flavour develops over time and how this is affected by the temperature of the air and water. Ingredients make a real difference too- the type ofbutter and the eggs used in a mixture and the way they emulsify. And then there's the importance of using your oven properly, taking care over any decoration and knowing the simple tricks that make a bake look great. There are two aspects to any bake: one is the base recipe; the other is flavour. Follow the base recipe to the letter initially- whether it's a Victoria sponge, Genoise, bread or croissant, don't change the recipe. When it comes to flavours, though, you can play around. You might think you need some more raspberries, 9 or cut them back, or change onions to mushrooms. But only do that after you've mastered the base recipe first and made it two or three times, so you have confidence in what you're doing. Ingredients do differ and you have to notice and respond to that as you bake. Different brands of flour may absorb up to five per cent more or less liquid. A good flour will absorb more liquid, which will give your bake more volume. Try the same recipe with different flours and you'll see the difference, and discover your own preferences. There's a plethora of equipment around these days to make baking easier. But in the end I prefer to use as little kit as possible. All you really need is a bread scraper, a good serrated knife and digital scales. A set of digital scales is the item of equipment that has really changed home baking, and is essential. I started with balance scales at work and they were fine for 20kg quantities, but when you're dealing in hundreds of grams digital precision makes a real difference. Bread scrapers are great for cutting dough and scraping it off surfaces, or smoothing icing on the top or sides of a cake. When you get one for the first time, you realise what you've been missing. I've used a Scotch scraper for forty years and I'll never be without one. A serrated knife is the most effective tool for cutting bakes. You can use it for cutting a sponge into discs, just as you do for slicing bread. Bakeware is much better than it used to be. It's worth buying good -quality trays and tins, as they'll last longer and won't warp. If you buy decent kit, the only thing you'll ever have to change is the battery in your digital scales. Baking teaches you patience and creativity, but more than that it teaches you what goes into your food. It helps you learn about ingredients and what they do in pastries, cakes and pies. It's also a family thing. Once a recipe is good, you can pass it on to 10 the rest of your family so they continue to make it. That's why it's very nostalgic -when people watch Bake Off and see a particular kind of cake, they think, 'My grandma used to make a cake like that and it was delicious,' then they want to make it themselves. Home baking and passing down these recipes has long been a tradition in Britain. We have always been good bakers in this country, but people sometimes forget that fact. I think people here are bakers before they are cooks. One reason is that cooking can be about sourcing special ingredients, whereas baking starts with the basics. Flour, sugar, salt and yeast are what we use- all raw ingredients that you have already in the cupboard. Anyone can bake, and you can start at any age. If you can get a few core bakes right - a Victoria sandwich, a favourite bread, a beautiful brioche, a buttery croissant- you will enter a whole new world of enjoyment, and save yourself money in the shops at the same time. Over the years, I've not only perfected my techniques and recipes, but also come to understand what it means to be a baker. The things I've learnt from decades as a professional are just as useful for the home baker who wants to make a weekend loaf, a batch ofbiscuits, a pie, a pud, a tart or a celebration cake. So this is what I'm sharing with you now- the recipes, lessons and experiences from my baker's life. A NOTE ON OVEN TEMPERATURE The baking times in m y recipes are for conventional ovens. If you are using a fan-assisted oven, you will need to lower the oven setting by around 1 0- 15°C. Ovens vary, so use an oven thermometer to verify the temperature and check your bakes towards the end of the suggested cooking time. 11 YOU ASSOCIATE YOUR childhood withfoodbecauseitmakes such an impact at the time. Sweet foods and other bakes are treats. They mean you've been good, or are having a good time. These are the moments that you find yourself remembering decades later. Baking is in my genes. My dad was a baker and when I was born in 1966 we lived in a flat above his shop. He would start work at 4am and the flat was permanently full of the smell ofbread. When my mum came down to gel the doughnuts she would hang me on a baby bouncer at the bottom of the stairs by the shop. I'd bounce away for hours, watching people bake. We moved to asemi-detachedhouse in Wallasey, in the Wirral, when I was very young and that's where I grew up. We were a very tight community where everyone knew each other and the kids all played outside in the street. My mum still lives in the same house, and she was born and raised in the next road. My mum hates cooking but she's creative- she worked as a graphic artist- and her pastry work and her biscuits were great. We were much involved in the church and that's where I saw a lot of cakes, bread and, predominantly, tray bakes. If someone had a birthday, we'd have a big bash or we'd go on an outing, perhaps to the seaside, and everyone would bring food to the table- my nan and mum included. Nowadays people are baking at home much more again but there was a gap of around twenty years when people just bought pre-made food. What I am part of now is a return to that ethos ofbakingyourself. On a Saturday, my mum used to make a fruit pie for Sunday lunch, all from scratch. The fruit- rhubarb, apples or pears- was always home-grown. I would climb the apple tree in our garden with my two younger brothers, Jason and Lee, partly to pick apples and partly to get onto the shed roof to be naughty and throw stones. NOSTALGIC BAKES 14 I t I ~ Saturday was a fun day; there was no school and my dad was off work so I'd get to see him. In the afternoon, he'd bake bread rolls, making dough in a bowl, shaping the buns and putting them on a tray to rise in front of a gas fire with a damp cloth over the top. I remember lifting the cloth to have a quick look. They were growing. Then he baked them off, and they were absolutely delicious. I would recognise that flavour anywhere; it's the taste of something home-made. My dad was a baker who knew his stuff, and he understood that the longer you rise a bread before you knock it back and let the shaped loaf prove (grow again), the greater the flavour. It's down to fermentation- one of the most important lessons for any baker. While the rolls were proving, I remember Dad sitting down and watching the wrestling on a Saturday- invariably Big Daddy was up against Giant Haystacks- and we'd be there, me and my two brothers. Then we would watch a bit of the Generation Game, a TV game show where novices tried to copy a skill demonstrated by a professional. At the age of six, I remember seeing a guy plaiting bread and being fascinated. Thirty-odd years later, I went on the Generation Game myself and plaited bread, just like that baker. My nans- Olive and Amy -lived in fiats above shops in big Victorian houses and they each had a minute kitchen and a pantry. The smell ofbaking always struck me in my dad's mum's house. She ran a launderette until she was eighty. Tough as old boots. She used to say to me, 'Your dad's the best baker in the country. He works all the hours God sends.' So I grew up with this sense of good baking. Both sides of the family were grafters. My great-great-great grandfather on Mum's side used to run across Scotland and back in a week, delivering and collecting the post for his community on the west coast. It was the equivalent of about twenty-one marathons a month. I didn't know that when I was growing up, NOSTALGIC BAKES 15 - I l but I had a lot of energy as a child- in double-games I would opt to run round and round a field without stopping- and later on, I regularly did thirteen- or fourteen-hour shifts as a baker. My dad built up achainofbakeries in the Northeast and as a child and teenager I'd go along with him to help out or watch the lads work. There was a very old stainless steel machine that was used to pierce each doughnut, then you'd pull two levers to inject the perfect amount of jam. Sometimes I'd do it with my brother and we'd go ge-dung, ge-dung, ge-dung, putting more and more jam in until the doughnuts became like jam bombs. My dad's bakeries were all open plan. In the front, there was the shop area displaying all the cakes and cream cakes, the steak and kidney pies, the sausage rolls and the bread on racks. Then you would swing round to a patisserie area with rum truffles and little brownies. I used to disappear off and talk to the people in the shop, to ask ifl could take a cream doughnut. It would seem almost as big as my head but I'd eat the lot. My dad would go mad, saying, 'Why's he doing that- he won't eat his dinner!' I had no idea that I wanted to be a baker back then. At the time I was just fascinated by baking and everything that went with it -the white aprons hanging on washing lines with Dad's checks, white t-shirts and long white coats. Ifl hugged my dad when he came back from work, he always had that smell ofbread. Years later, I remember coming home from my bakery and my lad Joshua saying to me: 'Dad, you smell like a loaf!' NOSTALGIC BAKES 17 MY MUM'S GINGER BISCUITS MAKES 25 - 30 Mum used to make these easy biscuits several times a week. Not only are they a doddle to make but they've got the right balance ofbeing crispy and chewy. You can use butter instead of margarine if you like; they taste great either way. ------------------------~------------------~~--*M~~--~--------~.----- llOg margarine llOg caster sugar llOg golden syrup 225g self-raising flour, plus extra for dusting 2 tsp ground ginger Heat your oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Line two large baking trays with baking parchment. Melt the margarine, caster sugar and golden syrup together gently in a saucepan over a medium heat. Once melted, remove from the heat and let cool slightly. Add all of the dry ingredients to the pan and stir to combine and make a smooth dough. Once the dough is cool enough to handle, use lightly floured hands to roll into balls, each the size of a 50p piece. Place them on the baking trays, leaving enough room in between to allow them to spread during cooking. Mark the top of each ball with a fork. Put the baking trays into the oven and bake for about 10-12 minutes, or until the biscuits are golden brown. Remove from the oven and leave to cool and firm up slightly on the tray, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. NOSTALGIC BAKES 19 MILLIONAIRE'S SHORTBREAD WITH SALTED CARAMEL MAKES ABOUT 12 BARS What is there not to like about a caramel chocolate biscuit? I've tried some good shop-bought millionaire's shortbread but it's even better if you make it yourself, as you can choose the chocolate and cut it into the size of pieces you want. I've updated this childhood favourite by adding salt to the caramel and a topping of macadamia nuts. This version is a great For the base 150g unsalted butter, softened 75g caster sugar 175g plain flour A pinch of fine salt 25g fine semolina or ground rice For the salted caramel filling 120g condensed milk 60g golden syrup 150gunsalted butter 150g soft light brown sugar 1 tsp sea salt flakes For the topping favourite of my son Josh. Heat your oven to 150°C/ Gas 2. Line a shallow 27 x 18cm baking tin with baking parchment. To make the base, in a bowl, cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the flour, salt and semolina or ground rice and mix with a spoon and then your hands to form a smooth dough; try not to overwork it. Press the mixture into the prepared tin and prick the surface all over with a fork. Bake for 35-40 minutes until pale but cooked through. For the salted caramel filling, weigh all the ingredients except the salt into a pan. Melt over a medium heat, stirring occasionally, and then bring to the boil. As it boils, keep stirring- the caramel bubbles will become larger and the mixture will thicken and turn a rich, glossy caramel colour. 200g dark chocolate (I use Pour the caramel evenly over the shortbread, sprinkle on the sea salt chocolate with 40% cocoa flakes and leave to cool and set. solids, like Bourneville), cut into small pieces For the topping, melt the chocolate in a heatproofbowl suspended 50g macadamia nuts, over a pan of simmering water, making sure the bottom of the bowl roughly chopped doesn't touch the water. Pour the melted chocolate over the caramel layer so it is completely covered, spread to level and smooth the surface with a palette knife. Scatter over the macadamia nuts. Leave to set completely, then cut into bars. NOSTALGIC BAKES 20 JAM TARTS MAKES 15 - 20 My mum used to make these for us when we were little, often using leftover pastry from a pie. She'd dollop brightly coloured Robinson's strawberry or raspberry jam into the pastry cases. Her tip is to not fill them too much or the jam can gurgle over and make a mess. Jam tarts are simple to make but we love them and they're worth rediscovering for family teas or children's parties. 170g self-raising flour, plus extra for dusting 85gcold unsalted butter or margarine, cut into small dice 1-3 tbsp cold water About15 tsp jam (any flavour) They are very basic, very cheap- and a treat. Heat your oven to 200°C/Gas 6 and have ready two shallow 12-hole bun trays. Put the flour into a bowl, add the butter or margarine and rub in with your fingers until the mixture resembles bread crumbs. Stir in just enough water to bring it together to form a dough. Roll out the pastry dough on a lightly floured work surface to a 4mm thickness. Using a 6.5- 7cm fluted pastry cutter, cut out 15-20 circles. Use the pastry rounds to line the bun trays (you'll probably have some spare hollows). Add a scant teaspoonful of jam to each pastry case -not too much or it will ooze everywhere. Re-roll the leftover pastry to make more tarts or use a star cutter to cut lids and position on top of the jam filling. Bake in the oven for about 25-30 minutes, until the pastry is pale brown, checking after 20 minutes. Leave the tarts to cool in the trays for 5 minutes, then carefully remove and place on a wire rack. Leave to cool completely. NOSTALGIC BAKES 23 STICKY GINGER TRAY BAKE MAKES 15 SLICES The beauty of a tray bake is that it's easy to transport in the tin you bake it in and then cut into portions to share out. Ginger is a simple way of flavouring a sponge and stem ginger adds a little texture, as well as a fresh and fragrant kick. The ginger syrup soaks into the sponge and makes it shine on top. ------·----------------·-~------------~-.--~·--~~--,~·--·~·~---------------- 220g unsalted butter, softened 220g soft dark brown sugar 3large eggs, beaten 220g self-raising flour 1 tbsp ground ginger 4 knobs of stem ginger, chopped into small pieces 2 tbsp stem ginger syrup For the ginger syrup 60g soft dark brown sugar lOOmlwater Y2 tsp ground ginger Heat your oven to 180°C/ Gas 4. Line a 30 x 20cm baking tin with baking parchment. In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the beaten eggs a little at a time, beating well to incorporate each addition. Sift the flour and ground ginger together over the mixture and gently fold in. Finally, fold in the chopped stem ginger and syrup. Pour the mixture into the prepared tin and gently level the surface. Bake for 25- 30 minutes, until risen and springy to the touch. Leave to cool slightly. For the syrup, gently heat the sugar, water and ground ginger together in a small pan until the sugar is dissolved. Bring to the boil and let the syrup bubble away until it thickens a little. While the tray bake is still warm, make small holes all over the surface with a skewer then pour on the syrup, so it seeps into the holes. Leave to cool completely. Cut into pieces to serve. NOSTALGIC BAKES 24 ,- -- ORANGE & WALNUT TRAY BAKE MAKES 15 SLICES Here's a tray bake based on an afternoon cake I love, walnut with orange instead of the more usual coffee and walnut. The softness of the sponge, the walnuts and the intense flavour from the citrus fruit make it delicious withacupoftea. 220gunsalted butter, softened 220g caster sugar 3large eggs, beaten Finely grated zest of Yz orange plus 2 tbsp juice 1 tsp orange extract 220g self-raising flour 100g chopped walnuts For the topping 60g unsalted butter, softened 250g full-fat cream cheese 200g icing sugar, plus extra for dusting Finely grated zest of 1orange 1 tsp orange extract 60g walnut halves Heat your oven to 180°C/ Gas 4. Line a 30 x 20cm baking tin with baking parchment. In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar, until light and fluffy. Gradually add the beaten eggs, beating well after each addition. Add the orange zest, juice and extract and stir to incorporate. Gently fold in the flour and chopped walnuts. Tip the mixture into the prepared tin and gently level the surface. Bake for 25-30 minutes, until risen and springy to the touch. Leave to cool slightly in the tin before removing and transferring to a wire rack. Leave to cool completely. For the topping, beat the butter, cream cheese and icing sugar together until smooth, then beat in the orange zest and extract. Spread the icing over the top of the tray bake with a palette knife or the back of a large spoon and decorate with the walnut halves. Cut into pieces to serve. NOSTALGIC BAKES 27 COCONUT TRAY BAKE MAKES 12-15 SLICES There's something very British about a tray bake. This one has pretty pink icing dusted with desiccated coconut and was considered a favourite back in the seventies. Coconut is a tropical ingredient but it's along-standingpart of British baking, both as a flavouring and as a decoration- think of the Snowball and coconut macaroons. You can even serve this tray bake as a dessert, with plenty of custard- a popular school-dinner pud. 200gunsalted butter, softened 200g caster sugar 3large eggs, beaten 1 tsp vanilla extract 200g self-raising flour lOOg desiccated coconut 2-3 tbsp milk For the topping 150g icing sugar 1-2 tbsp cold water A few drops of pink food colouring 40g desiccated coconut ;, Heat your oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Line a 30 x 20cm baking tin with baking parchment. In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugartogetheruntillight and fluffy. Gradually add the beaten eggs, beating well after each addition, then stir in the vanilla extract. Add the flour and desiccated coconut and gently fold in. Finally add enough milk to achieve a loose enough consistency for the mixture to drop easily off a spoon. Pour the mixture into the prepared tin and gently level the surface. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until risen and springy to the touch. Allow to cool slightly in the tin, then remove and place on a wire rack. Leave to cool completely. To make the topping, sift the icing sugar into a bowl and add 2 tsp water with a few drops of pink colouring. Mix until smooth, then add more water, 1 tsp at a time, until you have a smooth, spreadable icing. Pour the icing onto the centre of the coconut cake and use a palette knife to spread it out to the edges. While the icing is still wet, sprinkle over the desiccated coconut. Leave to set before cutting into pieces. CHOCOLATE TEA CAKES MAKES 12 As a kid I loved Tunnock's Tea Cakes and I'm still partial to them now. There's that great moment when you bite through the crispy shell, hit that marshmallow and then the biscuit underneath. These are fun to make, too. ------·-------------=\"-\"-~--------------~--~--~·DM------~~~--- For the biscuit bases 200gplain flour, plus extra for dusting Y. tsp baking powder A pinch of fine salt 50g cold unsalted butter, cut into small dice 50g caster sugar 2-3 tbsp milk For the filling 3large egg whites 150g caster sugar 2 tbsp glucose syrup For the topping 300g dark chocolate (I use chocolate with 40% cocoa solids, like Bourneville), cut into small pieces For the biscuit bases, line two baking trays with baking parchment. Sift the flour, baking powder and salt together into a bowl. Add the butter and rub in using your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Stir in the sugar. Incorporate enough milk to bring the mixture together to form a ball. On a lightly floured surface roll out the dough to a 5mm thickness and stamp out 12 discs using a 7cm plain cutter. Place on the prepared trays. Chill for at least 30 minutes. Heat your oven to 170°C/Gas 3 Y:z. Bake the chilled dough discs for 12-15 minutes until lightly browned. Transfer the biscuits to a wire rack to cool and firm up. For the filling, put all the ingredients into a large heatproofbowl set over a pan ofhot (but not boiling) water, making sure the bottom of the bowl doesn't touch the water. Using a hand-held electric whisk, beat for about 8 minutes until you have a stiff, smooth and silky meringue mixture (the aim is to gently melt the sugar as you whisk). Spoon the mixture into a piping bag fitted with a medium plain nozzle and pipe a mound on each cooled biscuit base, leaving a small margin around the edge. Place the biscuits on a wire rack over a sheet of baking parchment. For the topping, melt 200g chocolate in a bowl over a pan ofhot water, making sure the bowl is not touching the water. Remove from the heat and add the rest of the chocolate so that it melts. Leave to cool slightly; it must not be too hot or it will melt the meringue. Spoon the chocolate onto the tea cakes to coat completely, allowing the excess to fall onto the parchment below, and smooth with a palette knife. If the chocolate gets too cool, put the bowl back over the pan ofhot water briefly. You can also re-melt the chocolate that has fallen onto the parchment. Allow the chocolate to set before serving.

A great first recipe to introduce children to baking, there are only three ingredients and it gets them into stirring well to ensure all the cornflakes are coated. Of course, the best bit is licking the bowl when you've finished. ----------~ ..

Stir until these are coated in chocolate, then add the remaining cornflakes and stir until they are all coated in chocolate. Divide the mixture between the paper cases and leave to cool and set before eating. NOSTALGIC BAKES 34 MARSHMALLOW CRISPY RICE BARS MAKES 9 LARGE OR 12 MEDIUM BARS When my mum used to make these, we'd never leave the mixture to set. By the time she'd tipped it into the tin, we'd be spooning it up. Leave it be until firm ... if you can. You can cut it into as many pieces as you like. The mixture is very sweet so some will prefer just a small nugget, others a large bar. 50g unsalted butter 2 tbsp golden syrup 200g marshmallows 125g crispy rice cereal 20g mini marshmallows, to finish Line the base and sides of a 20cm square tin with baking parchment. Put the butter, golden syrup and the 200g marshmallows into a large saucepan and heat gently until melted, stirring constantly to combine and prevent the mixture sticking. Remove the pan from the heat, add the rice cereal and mix until well coated in the marshmallow mix. Transfer the mixture to the prepared tin. As it is very sticky, cover the surface with a sheet ofbaking parchment and then press down well to level the surface. Remove the parchment and gently but firmly press down onto the mixture with the back of a large metal spoon. Scatter mini marshmallows over the surface and leave to cool, then cut into squares and remove from the tin. NOSTALGIC BAKES 36 TEA LOAF MAKES 1 LARGE TEA LOAF When I started baking, ingredients and kitchen kit used imperial measurements. Nowadays, everything is metric but many bakers and recipes still refer to loaf tins in pounds. This tea loaf is always baked in a 2lb tin (that's 900gin metric), with dimensions of roughly 23 x 13 x 7cm. --------------------------·----------------~-------~--~--------------- 150gsultanas 150g raisins 150gcurrants 150m! strong hot black tea 225g self-raising flour 175g demerara sugar !large egg, beaten 3-4 tbsp milk Put the dried fruit into a bowl, pour over the hot tea and stir well, then cover with cling film and leave to soak overnight. The next day, heat your oven to 160°C/ Gas 3. Line a 900g (2lb) loaf tin with baking parchment. Drain the soaked fruit and place in a large bowl. Add the flour, sugar, beaten egg and enough milk to give a dropping consistency, mixing well to combine. Spoon the mixture into the prepared loaf tin and level the surface with the back of a spoon. Bake for about 1 hour, or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Leave the loaf to cool in the tin for 5 minutes, then remove and place on a wire rack to finish cooling. Slice, spread with butter and enjoy. NOSTALGIC BAKES 39 SALLY LUNN MAKES 1 LOAF The bakeries in theN orthwest have a certain style. In other parts of the country, a Sally Lunn refers to a round tea bread or smaller buns. For us, it is a large, oval-shaped fruited bun, covered in icing, but made with the same enriched buttery dough, studded with dried fruit. It's best eaten freshly made. --------------------------·~--------------------~~------------------ 450g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting 3 tbsp caster sugar 7g instant dried yeast 7gfinesalt 40g unsalted butter, cut into small pieces, softened, plus extra for greasing 125ml whole milk About 125ml cold water 75g mixed dried fruit Finely grated zest ofl orange Finely grated zest ofllemon 1 tsp ground cinnamon 50g glace cherries, chopped For the icing 200g icing sugar 20-30ml water Put the flour and sugar into a large bowl. Add the yeast to one side of the bowl and the saltto the other. Add the butter, milk and three- quarters of the water. Using the fingers of one hand, mix everything together. Add the remaining water, a little at a time, until all the flour is incorporated- you want a soft but not soggy dough. (You may not need all the water or you may need a bit more; it depends on the flour.) Tip onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5-10 minutes until you have a soft, smooth dough. Place in a lightly greased bowl, cover with a tea towel and leave to rise for 1-3 hours, until doubled in size. Meanwhile, mix the dried fruit with the citrus zests, cinnamon and glace cherries. Line a large baking tray with baking parchment. Tip the risen dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knock back by folding it inwards repeatedly until all the air is knocked out. Shape into a large rectangle and scatter the fruit mix over the surface. Fold the dough over to encase the fruit, then knead to distribute it evenly. Dust the work surface with more flour and roll out the dough to a large rectangle, with a long side facing you. Fold each end into the middle, then roll up and turn over so the join is underneath. Roll the dough lightly, applying more pressure at the ends to create a long oval shape. Lift the loaf onto the prepared baking tray and place in a large, clean plastic bag. Leave to prove for about an hour, until doubled in size. Heat your oven to 190°0/Gas 5. Take the baking tray out of the plastic bag and place in the oven. Bake for 30-35 minutes until the loaf is risen and golden brown. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. For the icing, sift the icing sugar into a bowl and mix in enough water to make a thick but spreadable icing that coats the back of a spoon. Spread the icing evenly over the top of the cooled loaf and leave to set. Slice and serve with butter for spreading. NOSTALGIC BAKES 40 CUSTARD TART SERVES 8 As a lad, !found custard tarts from the bakery irresistible: a hand-held treat in a foil cup. Here is my recipe for a family-sized version, which makes a lovely pud. Don't stint on the nutmeg- this fragrant spice gives the tart its character. --------------------~·--~·-----~~--~~-------.. ---*\"------~--.~--------------.__..__ For the pastry 200gplain flour, plus extra for dusting 2 tbsp icing sugar lOOg cold unsalted butter, cut into small dice 1 medium egg, beaten Y, tsp lemon juice 2-3 tsp very cold water For the custard filling 250ml whole milk 350ml double cream 8 medium egg yolks BOg caster sugar Y. -Y. whole nutmeg For the pastry, mix the flour and icing sugar together in a bowl. Add the butter and rub in until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Make a well in the centre. In a jug, lightly whisk the egg with the lemon juice and 2 tsp cold water, then pour into the well. Mix into the flour, using one hand to bring the pastry together and adding a splash more water if needed. As the dough comes together, gently knead into a ball. Wrap in cling film and rest in the fridge for at least 30 minutes. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and roll out to a circle, about 3mm thick and large enough to line a 20cm loose-based tart tin. Lift the pastry into the tin and press into the edges, leaving the excess hanging over the top. Prick the base all over with a fork, then chill in the fridge for 15 minutes. Heat your oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Line the pastry case with a sheet of baking parchment and fill with baking beans. Bake 'blind' for 12-15 minutes, or until the pastry is dry to the touch and golden around the edge. Remove the beans and parchment and bake for a further 5-8 minutes, until the pastry case is crisp and light golden brown all over. Let cool, then use a small, sharp knife to trim away the excess pastry from the edge. Turn the oven down to 150°C/Gas 2. For the filling, pour the milk and cream into a pan and slowly bring to the boil. Meanwhile, whisk the egg yolks and sugar together in a bowl, then pour on the hot, creamy milk, stirring as you do so. Strain through a sieve into a jug and allow to settle for a few minutes. Pour the custard into the tart case, then finely grate the nutmeg over the surface until it is completely covered. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the custard is just set. Place the tart in its tin on a wire rack to cool; the custard will firm up as it cools down. You can keep this tart, covered, in the fridge, for a day or two but bring it back to room temperature before serving. NOSTALGIC BAKES 43 ,--------------- --------------------------- TRIFLE SERVES 6 To this day, no one makes trifle as good as my mum. She doesn't include any sherry in her recipe and that's how I like it- with no booze,just simple home-made sponge, fruit jelly, custard and cream. Forthen;flesponge 4 medium eggs, separated 125g caster sugar 125g plain flour Y. tsp baking powder 1 tbsp granulated sugar, for sprinkling For the custard 300rnl whole milk 300rnl double cream 1 vanilla pod, split lengthways 4large egg yolks 3 tbsp cornflour 2 tbsp caster sugar Forthefruitjelly 2 x 135g packets strawberry jelly, broken into cubes 300rnl boiling water 500rnl cold water 400g strawberries, hulled and halved For the topping 600rnl whipping cream 1 chocolate Flake bar -~----------·---·-----~·----~·-M~~~·-n---------------- For the trifle sponge, heat your oven to 190°C/Gas 5 and line a baking tin, about 20 x 27cm, with baking parchment. In a large bowl, whisk the egg yolks with 50g of the caster sugar until the mixture is smooth, thickened and paler in colour. In another, clean bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiff, then gradually add the remaining caster sugar, whisking well between each addition, to make a smooth, glossy meringue. Gently fold the meringue into the egg yolk mixture, a spoonful at a time, until it is all incorporated. Sift the flour and baking powder together over the mixture then fold in carefully, using a spatula, until evenly combined. Pour into the prepared tin and sprinkle the granulated sugar over the surface. Bake for 20 minutes, then lower the oven setting to 150°C/Gas 2 and bake for another 20 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. To make the custard, pour the milk and cream into a pan. Scrape in the seeds from the vanilla pod and add the empty pod. Heat gently until the milk is almost boiling. Meanwhile, beat the egg yolks, cornflour and sugar together in a bowl. Discard the vanilla pod, then slowly pour the hot creamy milk onto the beaten mixture, whisking as you do so. Pour back into the pan and stir over a low heat until the custard thickens. Take off the heat and cover the surface with cling film to prevent a skin forming. Put the jelly cubes into a heatproofbowl, pour on the boiling water and stir until the cubes melt. Add the 500ml cold water and stir. Cut the sponge into squares and layer in the base of a serving bowl (about 25cm diameter and lOcm deep). Scatter over the strawberry halves, then cover with the jelly and refrigerate until set. Pour the custard over the jelly and chill to set again. When ready to serve, whip the cream until thick and spread over the custard layer. Crumble the chocolate Flake over the surface to finish. NOSTALGIC BAKES 44 NO-BAKE CHEESECAKE SERVES 6 There are different kinds of cheesecake and the no-bake version is the one from my childhood. The key is to have the right amount of gelatine to make it firm enough to slice but still gently creamy. Decorate the top as you like. --------------------·-----~------~----------~··---~--------------- For the base lOOgunsalted butter, melted, plus extra for greasing 150g digestive biscuits For the filling 6.5g leaf gelatine (about 4 sheets Costa brand) 325g full-fat cream cheese 2 tbsp caster sugar 1 tsp vanilla extract 175ml double cream 60mljust-boiled water For the topping 4g leaf gelatine (about 2 Y. sheets Costa brand) 150ml red berry juice (any flavour- it's the colour that matters) 150g fresh or defrosted frozen summer berries Grease a 20cm loose-based cake tin with butter. For the base, put the digestive biscuits into a strong plastic bag and bash with a rolling pin to a crumb-like texture. Tip into a bowl, add the melted butter and stir until all the crumbs are coated. Spoon into the prepared tin, press down firmly onto the base and chill until set firm. For the filling, put the gelatine leaves into a heatproofbowl, cover with cold water and set aside to soften. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, mix the cream cheese with the caster sugar and vanilla extract, beating until smooth. In another bowl, whip the cream to soft peaks and then fold into the cream cheese mixture. Lift the gelatine leaves out of their bowl and squeeze to remove any excess water. Pour away the water then put the gelatine back into the bowl. Immediately pour on the 60mljust-boiled water and stir until the gelatine has dissolved, then fold into the cream cheese mixture until well combined. Pour the filling mixture onto the chilled biscuit base. Smooth and level the surface, using a small, angled palette knife or the back of a large spoon. Place in the fridge to set. For the topping, put the gelatine leaves into a small heatproofbowl, cover with cold water and leave to soften. Heat the berry juice in a pan but do not let it boil. Squeeze the gelatine to remove any excess water and discard the water in the bowl. Put the gelatine back into the bowl, pour over the hot berry juice and stir to dissolve. Leave the liquid to cool until slightly thickened but still pourable. Pour the thickened berry juice over the top of the set cheesecake and arrange the berries on top. Place in the fridge until set. Carefully remove the cheesecake from the tin and transfer to a fiat serving plate shortly before serving. NOSTALGIC BAKES 46 APPLE PIE SERVES 6 My mum's fruit pies were really good. She'd put sugar on the top before baking and add a little bit more after, to create the sugar crumb coating- delicious. The Bramleys came from our garden. She liked to serve the pie warm with Bird's custard, never cream. My tip is to sprinkle custard powder onto the base of the pastry case: this avoids a soggy bottom by soaking up some of the juices; it also gives a hint of subtle custard flavour to the filling. ----------------------~·~·----·--------~--~--~--------~~~·~---------------- For the pastry 275g plain flour, plus extra for dusting 2 tbsp icing sugar 140g cold butter, cut into small dice 3- 4 tbsp cold water For the filling 3large Brarnleys or other cooking apples 4 tbsp caster sugar 3tbspwater 2 tbsp custard powder For the glaze !medium egg, beaten 3 tsp caster sugar, for dusting For the pastry, mix the flour and icing sugar together in a bowl. Add the butter and rub in until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Using one hand, mix in just enough water to bring the pastry together and gently knead into a ball. Wrap in cling film and place in the fridge to rest while you make the filling. Peel and core the apples, then cut into slices, about 4cm long and 5mm thick. Tip into a saucepan and add the caster sugar and water. Cook over a medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the apples soften but still hold their shape. Leave to cool. Heat your oven to 200°C/ Gas 6 and have a 24cm pie plate ready. Divide the pastry into 2 pieces, roughly two-thirds and one-third. Lightly flour your work surface and roll out the larger piece of pastry to a 2-3mm thickness. Use this to line the base of the pie plate. Roll out the remaining pastry to form the lid for the pie and set aside. Sprinkle the custard powder over the pastry base and spoon the cooled apple filling on top. Brush the pastry edges with some of the beaten egg, then lift the pastry lid on top. Press the pastry edges together and crimp with a fork or pinch between your thumb and finger, then trim away any excess. Use the pastry trimmings to make leaves or other decorations, sticking them on top of the pie with a little beaten egg. Brush the top of the pie with beaten egg then sprinkle with 2 tsp of the caster sugar to glaze. Make 2 or 3 small slits in the top to let the steam out. Bake for 30-35 minutes, until the pastry is golden brown. Sprinkle an extra 1 tsp sugar over the surface. Leave the pie to rest for 15 minutes before serving. Enjoy with ice cream, cream or custard. NOSTALGIC BAKES 48 CREAMY MUSHROOM VOL-AU-VENTS MAKES 8 Vol-au-vents of various types often appeared at family gatherings when I was growing up. I liked a mushroom filling and remember using tinned mushroom soup as the base for a slightly dubious batch when I was at art school. This is a more refined version, with tasty dried porcini mushrooms and tarragon adding another layer of flavour to the button mushrooms. 500g block of ready-made all-butter puff pastry Plain flour, for dusting 1 medium egg, beaten, to glaze For the filling lOg dried porcini mushrooms, finely chopped 150mljust-boiled water 40gunsalted butter lOOgbaby button mushrooms, wiped and halved or quartered 20g plain flour 75ml double cream 1 tbsp finely chopped tarragon Salt and black pepper Line a large baking tray with baking parchment. Cutthe puff pastry block in half. Roll out one half on a lightly floured surface to a 5mm thickness and use a 6.5cm fluted cutter to stamp out 8 rounds. Use a 3.5cm plain cutter to cut out the middles from these. The little rounds will form the vol-au-vent tops, while the rings will become the sides. Roll out the other portion of puff pastry to a 3mm thickness and cut out 8 bases using the 6.5cm fluted cutter. Place the vol-au-vent bases and little tops on the prepared baking tray. Prick the bases with a fork, then brush the edge of each base with beaten egg and stick a pastry ring on top. Brush the surface of the rings and the little tops with beaten egg. Place in the fridge for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 200°C/ Gas 6. Bake the vol-au -vent cases for 15-20 minutes until risen, crisp and golden. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. To make the filling, put the dried porcini in a small heatproofbowl, add the boiled water and leave to soak for at least 30 minutes. Heat 20g of the butter in a frying pan until melted and foaming then add the button mushrooms. Cook on a high heat until starting to turn golden. Season with salt and pepper then remove from the pan and set aside. Melt the remaining 20g butter in the pan, then stir in the flour. Add a little of the soaked porcini with some of the liquor, stirring as it comes to the boil. Continue to slowly add the porcini and liquor until you have a smooth, thick sauce. Stir in the button mushrooms and cream. Taste to check the seasoning and add the chopped tarragon. Fill the cooked vol-au-vent cases with the mushroom mixture, top with the pastry lids and serve. NOSTALGIC BAKES 51 NAN'S MINCE & ONION PLATE PIE SERVES 4 - 6 As a kid I loved my nan's mince, onion and potatoes. That's all it was- minced beef, onion and potato, but boy did it taste good. This is the original recipe, which has been turned into a simple plate pie that nan would approve of. I love the crispness, flavour and gloss you get from the lard in the pastry. (I've used the same filling to create the posh puff pastry pithivier on page 55.) For the pastry 300g plain flour, plus extra for dusting A pinch of fine salt 80g cold unsalted butter, cut into small dice 70g cold lard, cut into small dice 4-6 tbsp cold water 1 medium egg, beaten, to glaze For the mince and onionfiUing 1 tbsp sunflower or vegetable oil 400gbeefmince 1 onion, chopped 1 tbsp plain flour 1large potato, peeled and cut into bite-sized dice 300mlwater 1 beef stock cube Salt and white pepper First make the filling. Heat the oil in a wide pan over a high heat. When hot, add the mince and onion and cook until the meat begins to brown, stirring from time to time to separate any lumps of meat. Lower the heat, add the flour and cook, stirring, for 2-3 minutes. Add the potato and water, then crumble in the stock cube. Season with salt (allowing for the saltiness of the stock cube) and pepper. Bring to the boil, then cover, lower the heat and simmer for 20-25 minutes until the gravy thickens and the potatoes are cooked through. Taste and add more salt and/or pepper if needed. Allow to cool, then chill. To make the pastry, put the flour and salt into a bowl. Add the butter and lard and rub in using your fingertips until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add just enough cold water to bring the dough together. Form into a ball, wrap in cling film and rest in the fridge for 30 minutes. Heat your oven to 200°0/Gas 6. Have ready a 23cm metal pie plate. Divide the pastry into two pieces, roughly two-thirds and one-third. Lightly dust your work surface with flour and roll out the smaller piece into a circle, about 3mm thick and slightly larger than your pie plate. Line the pie plate with this piece of pastry. Roll out the remaining pastry to a larger circle, about 26cm, ready to use as a lid, Spoon the chilled filling into the pastry-lined dish. Brush the pastry edges with beaten egg, then lift the pastry lid over the filling. Crimp the pastry edges firmly together with a fork, or pinch together using your thumb and forefinger, then trim away any excess pastry. Brush the top with beaten egg and make a small slit to let out the steam. Bake the pie for 30-35 minutes until golden brown. Leave to rest for 10-15 minutes before serving. NOSTALGIC BAKES 52 BEEF & POTATO PITHIVIER SERVES 4 - 6 This appealing French pie takes my nan's mince and onion filling (see page 52) to another level. In this recipe, it's important to use good puff pastry, made with butter- I prefer to roll out a block but you can use pre-rolled- and to mark it carefully with the tip of a knife in the traditional way. 500g block of ready-made all-butter puff pastry 1 quantity mince and onion filling (see page 52), cooked and chilled 1 medium egg, beaten, to glaze Cut the puff pastry block into two pieces, roughly two-thirds and one-third. Roll the smaller piece of pastry to a 4mm thickness and cut out a 25cm diameter circle for the pie base. Lift this onto a baking tray. Roll out the remaining pastry and cut out a larger circle, about 28cm, for the pie lid. Spoon the chilled mince and onion filling onto the pastry base, leaving a 2cm clear margin around the edge. Brush the pastry edge with beaten egg. Lift the pie lid into position over the filling and press the pastry edges together to seal. Use the tip of a sharp knife to score two horizontal lines around the side of the pie (this helps it to rise better). Brush the top of the pie with beaten egg. Now lightly score parallel curved lines, radiating from the centre to the edge of the pastry; this is to create a decorative effect- don't cut through the pastry. Make a small hole in the centre of the pie to let out the steam. Place the pie in the fridge for at least 30 minutes to rest. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Bake the pie for 35-40 minutes, until the pastry is risen and golden. Leave to stand for at least 5 minutes before cutting. NOSTALGIC BAKES 55 FINGER RO LS FOR HOT DOGS OR FISH FINGERS MAKES 12 These long rolls, with their soft, slightly sweet centre, are the perfect casing for hot dogs or fish fingers, so I've also included a great recipe for home-made fish fingers opposite. Before cooking them, I coat the fish in salt and sugar, then wash it off. This draws out some of the moisture and means you get SOOg strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting lOg instant dried yeast lOg fine salt 40g caster sugar 50gunsalted butter, cut into small dice, softened 170rnl whole milk About 150rnl cold water Oil, for oiling a firmer texture and better flavour. Put the flour into a large bowl and add the yeast to one side and the salt and sugar to the other. Add the butter, milk and three-quarters of the water. Stir the mixture together with the fingers of one hand. Gradually add the remaining water a little at a time until all the flour is incorporated and you have a rough dough. The dough should be soft but not soggy. (You may not need all the w~ter or you may need a little more; it depends on the flour.) Tip the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it for 5-10 minutes. At first it will be wet but as you knead it will become smooth and silky. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover ll?d leave to rise until doubled in size. This will take at least an hour and can take up to 3 hours, depending on the temperature. Line two baking trays with baking parchment. Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces. Roll each into a ball between the palms of your hands, then roll into fingers, about ~2cm long, on alightlyfloured surface. Place 6 fingers on each of the prepared trays, leaving a 1cm gap between to allow a little room for them to expand- but not too much as you want them to be touching once risen: Place each tray in a large, clean plastic bag and leave to prove for 45-60 minutes, until doubled in size. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 220°C/ Gas 7. Remove the trays from the plastic bags. Dust the finger rolls with flour and·bake for 10-15 minutes, until golden brown. Leave on the t;.rays for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool. They are perfect filled with sausages and ketchup, or the fish fingers on the opposite page. NOSTALGIC BAKES 56 HOME-MADE FISH FINGERS Cut 400g skinned and boned haddock or cod loin fish into 12 fingers, each about Bern long and l .Scm wide. Mix 70g fine salt and 70g caster sugar together in a bpwl. Coat each fish finger in the salt and sugar mix then place on a baking tray. Leave for 30 minutes or so, to draw out any liquid from the fish and firm up the flesh. Take 3 shallow bowls: put 50gplain flour in one, lightly beat 2large eggs in another, and tip 150g golden breadcrumbs into the third. Carefully rinse all the salt and sugar from the fish and pat dry with kitchen paper. Dip each fish finger in flour, dusting off any excess, then dip in the egg and finally coat in the breadcrumbs. Dip each fish finger again in the egg and crumbs to give a second coating. In a large frying Pllfl. heat eno~gh sunflower oil to shallow-fry the fish fingers. Fry them in batches until golden brown and crispy, turning once. SESAME-TOPPED BUNS FOR BURGERS MAKES 8 The first burger I ever ate was at a Wimpy, when that restaurant chain was the coolest thing on the planet. Here's my recipe for home-made buns with sesame seeds on top, to make your burger special. I've also given a recipe for the burgers, as making your own means you can use good-quality mince and add extra tasty seasoning. 500g strong white bread fl. our, plus extra for dusting 7gfinesalt 7ginstantdriedyeast 40gunsalted butter, cut into small dice, softened 2 tsp caster sugar About 225rnl whole mi1J< About lOOrnl cold water 50g sesame seeds, for sprinkling Oil, for oiling Put the flour into a large bowl and add the salt to one side and the yeast to the other. Tip in the butter pieces and sugar. Combine the milk and water in a jug, then pour three-quarters into the flour mixture and turn the mixture around with the fingers of one hand to mix. Continue to add the remaining liquid, a little at a time, until all the flour is incorporated. The dough needs to be soft, but not soggy. (You may not need all the liquid or you may need a little more; it depends on the flour.) Tip the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it for 5-10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Place in a lightly oiled bowl, cover and leave to rise for about an hour. Line two baking trays with baking parchment. Tip the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead to knock out any air. Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces and shape each into a smooth ball by placing it in a cage formed by your cupped hand on the work surface and moving your hand around in a circular motion, rotating the ball rapidly. Place on the trays, allowing room to spread. Place each baking tray in a large, clean plastic b<!-g and leave the rolls to prove until doubled in size. This will take about an hour or longer, depending on the temperature. Heat your oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Just before baking, remove the trays from the plastic bags. Brush the tops of the rolls with water and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake for 15 minutes then lower the oven setting to 160°C/Gas 3 and bake for a further 5-10 minutes, until risen and golden brown. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. MY HOME-MADE BURGERS Heat 2 tsp oil in a frying pan and cook 1 diced, small onion gently until softened; leave to cool. Put 100g fresh breadcrumbs into a large bowl, pour on 100ml milk and leave to soak for 5 minutes or until all the milk is absorbed. Add 600g good-quality minced beef, the cooled onion, 1 crushed garlic clove, 1 tsp mustard powder, Y2 tsp celery salt and Y2 tsp fine salt. Work with your hands, squeezing the mixture together so it is thoroughly combined. Divide the mixture into 8 equal pieces, roll into balls and flatten to shape into burgers. Cover loosely with cling film and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to firm up slightly until ready to cook. Heat your grill to high. Place the burgers on a baking tray and grill, about 6-7cm from the heat, for 6 minutes. Turn over and cook the other side for 6 mi,nutes or until the meat is cooked through. Serve each burger in a sesame-topped bun with lettuce, sliced tomato, gherkins, sliced red onion and mayonnaise. I DEF Y ANYONE TO MAKE oneloafandnevermakeanother. All it takes is that little bit of ambition to have a go in the first place- and it's easier than you think. Bread-making machines can be a good way to start, as all you have to do is weigh up ingredients and then leave the machine to it. The next step is to make a loaf that you knead yourself; you'll have more control this way because when you touch a dough, you can feel that it's lively and good, and you can smell it as well. How did I learn? In my mid-teens, I'd followed my mum's path and went to Wallasey Art School, where I got particularly into sculpture. My dad now lived in York and had a chain of about eighteen bakeries. When Dad asked me ifi wanted to become a baker, I initially said no. Then he offered to pay me £500- a lot of money in those days- ifi'd cut my long hair and join the industry. That put things in a different light for a seventeen-year-old! I set out to become a baker. My dad put me to work with the best guys he had at each of the bakeries, to train me in their particular skills; they were mostly old school bakers and all great at their jobs. I also picked up the basic know-how of working in a bakery, such as not to just grab a tray but always tap it first to avoid getting burnt. Being the son of the boss means you always get the toughest jobs. I had a lot to prove, so I had to work twice as hard as anyone else. The shift started at one o'clock in the morning and we finished about ten hours later. I used to like working through the night, when it was quiet, finishing midway through the day with a huge sense of relief. But this was six days a week and it was gruelling work. I was only young when I started, and I was working alongside big stocky lads from Bootle. These lads were much bigger than me and they were lugging flour bags I could barely lift- a minimum of16kg BEGINNER'S BREAD 62 r- -- - --~ I and you'd sometimes carry a couple on each shoulder when the flour delivery for the week came on a Thursday. You build up your body quickly carrying sacks like that, as well as big hot trays on your fingertips. Within six months, I was as quick and strong as they were. When you begin as an apprentice baker, you're a mixing lad or a table hand. Mixing starts with measuring. This is as important for the home baker as for the professional. If you don't weigh up the ingredients properly at the beginning- a half ounce out, either way - you've screwed up the whole process. And, just as for the home baker, the quality of the ingredients has got to be right: put rubbish in, you'll get rubbish out. The next job I learnt was to 'scale off' llb or 2lb pieces of dough on an old-fashioned scale with weights on one side and a pan on the other. You had to do it quick: bang, bang, bang, bang. There might be six or seven guys waiting to mould the dough into cobs, cottage loaves or tin loaves. After that, you moved on to the table. Moulding is a manual skill. Once you've got it, it never leaves you. Some are faster than others; I tended to be fairly quick. I am rubbish at academic stuff, but manual? You show me something once and I won't stop until I've mastered it. Finally comes the most important job- and this person really runs the bakery - feeding the oven. My first was an eight-foot oven with five decks and three trays on each one. I twas huge and made your back strain from lifting trays and filling it from top to bottom. You cannot, cannot have an empty space in the oven from the moment you start to the end of the day. Electric or gas, that oven's costing you money and you have to keep it baking at all times. You spend the whole shift juggling and figuring out where the heat is in your oven and the best position to bake things in. Every deck has its own character. You have to know where the BEGINNER'S BREAD 63 - hot spots are, the best place for the Genoise or the barm cakes. Learn to love your oven and it can be your best friend - or else it can be your worst enemy. In a bakery shift, you start with the breads. Because they need the greatest heat, they go in when the oven has been fired up. You pop the meringues in last thing, when the oven is cooling down, leave the oven door open and take the trays out the next day, first thing. Early on, I made the classic mistake of coming in, closing the oven door, firing up the oven and burning all the meringues. My dad's chain ofbakeries was what we called 'hot bread shops', designed so you could see and talk to the baker working at the back. Old dears would come in and say, 'Put that loafback in and burn it for me.' They like bread darker in the North, with more of a caramel colour and a crust; down South they prefer it lighter. Looking back, working in this type of shop meant I saw that bakers didn't have to be stuck away but could be out and about, talking about what we do. One day when I was working in the Lincoln shop, the head baker didn't turn up. As assistant baker, I took over. It all turned out beautifully. I was really proud of the cakes, scones, pies, breads, baps, harms, sticks, tin breads. Everything was great. I thought: I understand now. All it took was someone to be off for me to take responsibility and to do it myself. The lessons I learnt translate to home baking. First of all, get stuck in. Making bread is so satisfying and every time you learn more about each stage. Get a decent set of digital scales and weigh your ingredients accurately. Get your oven clean so you haven't got hot spots in there. Try not to open the oven door too often. Ideally, have an oven with a glass front and clean the front window, then either turn the light on inside or use a torch if you need to look inside without opening the door. Make the same recipe several times and, best of all, take notes of what the difference is between bakes. BEGINNER ' S BREAD 65 The initial mixing of the dry ingredients takes place in a large bowl. The flour goes in first, followed by the salt and yeast. It's important to keep these two ingredients separate- adding them to opposite sides of the bowl - as the sal twill slow down (or even kill) the yeast in its concentrated form. Different flours absorb different amounts of water. Add about three-quarters of the water quantity given in a recipe and mix it into the flour with your hands, adding as much as you need of the rest, or some more. You learn how to feel how much water is needed through experience. For continental breads or sourdough loaves with a more open structure, wetter is better. It is easier to mix very wet doughs, such as baguette dough, in a food mixer. You then tip the whole dough out onto a work surface. If it's a dough with butter in it, I'd use a little dusting of flour. For other doughs, I began to advise oiling the work surface because so many people were coming up to me and saying that their bread was tight, with small holes and a poor rise. This can partly be down to putting too much flour on the work surface as you knead. By oiling the surface instead, you keep the dough soft, it doesn't stick so much and, crucially, you don't get any more flour going in. There is no hard-and-fast rule for kneading bread. Some people slap a wet dough on the work surface, some people stretch it. I tend to constantly roll, roll, stretch, stretch. Each of these techniques builds up the gluten that makes the bread rise and hold its shape. Everyone has a way that works for them. You then need to let the dough rise. Slower is better as it means more flavour. That's why I recommend using cold rather than warm water and leaving the dough in a cool place - even the fridge sometimes- so that the yeast works less quickly. Some of the doughs in this chapter use relatively little yeast, which also promotes a slow rise. After the initial rise, you need to knock back and shape the dough. Knocking back gets rid of the air pockets and creates BEGINNER'S BREAD 66 a uniform texture so the dough rises evenly. To do this and to shape the dough, for most breads you just fold and fold. It's a bit like folding paper: the dough becomes stronger, and the finished loafis more able to hold its shape. This is especially important for breads you make without a tin. For baguettes, I let the dough rise in a square or rectangular tub that's not too deep- an old ice-cream tub works well- so you can tip the dough onto the work surface without losing too much air. You then knock it back less, and shape the loaf more carefully. Next comes the final rise, or proving. Give dough plenty of time to prove. Again, you learn by touch when a loaf is ready to go in the oven: it should spring back when gently pressed with a finger. You want to catch the dough when it is at the top of its rise, before the yeast is exhausted and the dough stops rising and starts to slacken. For novices, I'd recommend starting with soda bread, without a shadow of a doubt. It's simple and doesn't need proving at all. Kids won't be bored and it'll take 45 minutes from the time you start to the time you bring it out of the oven. The next stage is making bread in a tin. There's only one way that a tin bread can rise, and that's up. Then make rolls and build up to bigger cobs. Finally you can get on to sourdough, which is more complex and harder to handle but worth the effort; for some it's really the ultimate bread. Once you've finished your loaf and it's come out of the oven, the killer is leaving it to cool when all you want to do is eat it. Leave it on your wire rack, admire it, photograph it, Instagram it, Tweet it, tell all your friends. Then you slice it. The time you really want your own loaf is in the morning when you wake up and remember that you've got that bread downstairs that you made yesterday. Stick a slice in the toaster. Butter, jam or marmalade, mug of tea, first bite: that's when you realise your life has changed forever. BEGINNER'S BREAD 67 FLOURYBAPS MAKES 12 These are my version of the rolls that my dad made at the weekend and left to prove in front of our gas fire. This was the first recipe that really showed me the magic ofbread; how ingredients put together from the cupboard would mysteriously rise and then make a bake with a beautiful home-made taste. 500g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting 7ginstant driedyeast 7gfinesalt 40g caster sugar 40gunsalted butter, cut into small pieces, softened About 320ml cold water Oil, for oiling Put the flour into a large bowl and add the yeast to one side and the salt and sugar to the other. Add the butter and about three-quarters of the water. Turn the mixture around with the fingers of one hand to mix, gradually adding more of the water, until you have picked up all the flour. The dough needs to be soft but not soggy. (You may not need all of the water or you may need a little more; it depends on the flour.) Tip the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it for 5- 10 minutes. At first the dough will be wet but as you knead it will become smooth and silky. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a clean tea towel and leave to rise until doubled in size. This will take at least an hour and can take 2-3 hours or longer. 1 j Tip the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and fold it inwards repeatedly until all the airis knocked out. Atthis stage, you're starting to form the structure of the dough so it rises upwards rather than spreading outwards. Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces. (Until you can instinctively determine the correct size of each roll, it's a good idea to weigh the whole dough and divide the figure by 12, then check you have the correct weight for each piece.) Lightly dust your work surface with flour. Shape each piece of dough into a smooth ball by placing it in a cage formed by your cupped hand on the work surface and moving your hand around in a circular motion, rotating the ball rapidly. Sitthe rolls on a floured surface and cover with a clean tea towel. Leave to rest for 30 minutes. Line two baking trays with baking parchment. Remove the tea towel and use a rolling pin to flatten each ball of dough so it doubles in width. Place on the prepared trays, leaving enough space in between for them to expand. Place each tray in a large, clean plastic bag and leave to prove for 45-60 minutes, or until doubled in size. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 220°C/Gas 7. Remove the trays from the bags and lightly dust the surface of the rolls with flour. Bake for 10-15 minutes or until risen and golden brown. Leave to cool on the tray for 5 minutes and then transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling. TV ROLLS MAKES 6 These are known as 'TV rolls' because of the square mould used to cut them out in bakeries, including my dad's. You'll discover that they go slightly odd shapes when they bake, but that doesn't matter. 500gstrongwhite bread flour, plus extra for dusting lOg instant dried yeast lOg fine salt 20g unsalted butter, cut into small pieces, softened About 320rnl cold water Oil, for oiling Put the flour into a large bowl and add the yeast to one side and the salt to the other. Add the butter and pour in three-quarters of the water. Turn the mixture around with the fingers of one hand to mix then continue to add more of the water, a little at a time, until all the flour is incorporated and you have a rough dough. The dough needs to be soft but not soggy. (You may not need all the water or you may need a little more; it depends on the flour.) Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it for 5-10 minutes, working through the wet stage until it becomes soft and smooth. Put the dough into a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a clean tea towel and leave to rise until doubled in size. This will take at least an hour and can take 2-3 hours or longer, depending on the room temperature. Line a roasting tin (not a shallow baking tray) with baking parchment. Tip the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and fold it inwards repeatedly to knock out the air. Shape the dough into a chunky rectangle, 4-5cm high. Cut this into 6 equal squares, using a sharp knife or pizza wheel. Place the rolls in the prepared tin, leaving enough space in between for them to double in size. Place the roasting tin in a large, clean plastic bag and leave to prove for about an hour until the rolls have doubled in size. The dough is ready when it springs back when lightly prodded. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 200°C/ Gas 6. Remove the tin from the bag and dust the rolls with flour. Bake for 15 minutes, or until the rolls are risen and golden brown. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. BEGINNER'S BREAD 70 MAKES 1 LARGE LOAF This is the staple white bread that my dad used to make in his bakeries. It uses a small amount of yeast and a lengthy eight-hour fermentation, because allowing the dough to rise slowly gives the best flavour. 500g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting 2g instant dried yeast (Y. tsp) lOg fine salt 40gunsalted butter, cut into small pieces, softened About 320rnl cold water Oil, for oiling Put the flour into a large bowl and add the yeast to one side and the salt to the other. Don't put the salt onto the yeast, as it can kill the yeast, or at the very least slow it down. Add the butter and three-quarters of the water. Turn the mixture around with the fingers of one hand to mix and continue to add the remaining water, a little at a time, until all the flour is incorporated. The dough needs to be soft but not soggy. (You may not need all of the water or you may need a little more; it depends on the flour.) Tip the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it for 5-10 minutes. Work it well, going through the initial wet stage until the dough becomes smooth and elastic. Put the dough into a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a clean tea towel and leave to rise in a cool place (but not the fridge) for at least 8 hours or overnight. Taking time over this stage helps the dough to develop more flavour. Lightly oil a 900g (2lb) loaf tin. Tip the dough onto a lightly floured surface and fold it inwards repeatedly until all the air is knocked out. At this stage, you are starting to form the structure of the dough to encourage it to rise upwards rather than spreading outwards (the tin also helps with this). Shape the dough into an oblong by flattening it and folding the sides into the middle. Roll up the dough so the top is smooth and you have a join in the middle on the underside. Place the dough in the prepared tin with the join underneath. Put the loaf tin inside a large, clean plastic bag and leave the loaf to prove until it has doubled in size. This will take at least an hour and can take 2-3 hours. The dough is ready when it springs back quickly when gently prodded with a finger. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 220°C/Gas 7 and place a roasting tin in the bottom. BEGINN ER' S BREAD 72 Remove the proved loaf from the bag. Dust the surface of the loaf with flour and then use a sharp knife to make a 2cm deep slash along the top, nearly to the ends. Carefully pour enough hot water into the tin in the oven to almost fill it- this will create steam. Bake the loaf for 15 minutes then lower the oven setting to 190°C/ Gas 5 and bake for a further 25- 30 minutes. Remove the loaf from the tin and tap the base: it should sound hollow. If not, put the loafback in the tin and return to the oven for another 5 minutes. Remove the loaf from the tin and transfer to a wire rack. Leave to cool completely. WHOLEMEAL TIN LOAF MAKES 1 LARGE LOAF Wholemeal flour keeps the best bits of the wheat kernel and more of the fibre than white flour, resulting in a loaf with more nutrients and flavour- you can really taste the earthiness, especially if you use stoneground flour. It's one of my favourite ingredients and makes a loaf that I love. Like the split tin loaf on the previous page, it has a small amount of yeast and a long, slow fermentation, to allow the dough to rise slowly for optimum flavour. 350g strong stoneground wholemeal bread flour, plus extra for dusting the loaf 150g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting the work surface 2g instant dried yeast (Y. tsp) lOg fine salt 40gunsalted butter, cut into small pieces, softened 20g malt extract About 340ml cold water Oil, for oiling Put both flours into a large bowl and add the yeast to one side and the salt to the other. Add the butter, malt extract and about three-quarters of the water. Turn the mixture around with the fingers of one hand to mix (or use a round-bladed knife first and then your fingers) and continue to add more of the water, a little at a time, until all of the flour is incorporated. The dough needs to be soft but not soggy. (You may not need all of the water or you may need a little more; it depends on the flour.) Tip the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for 5-10 minutes, working the dough through the initial wet stage until it is smooth and silky. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover with a clean tea towel and leave to rise in a cool place (but not the fridge) for at least 8 hours or overnight. This long, slow rise allows plenty of time for the flavour to develop. Lightly oil a 900g (2lb) loaf tin. Tip the dough onto a lightly floured surface and fold it inwards repeatedly until all the air is knocked out. Shape the dough into an oblong by flattening it and folding the sides into the middle. Roll up the dough so the top is smooth and you have a join in the middle on the underside. Place in the prepared loaf tin with the join underneath. Putthe tin inside a large, clean plastic bag and leave until doubled in size. This will take at least an hour and can take 2-3 hours, depending on the room temperature. When you prod it lightly with your finger, the dough should spring back quickly. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 220°C/Gas 7 and put a roasting tin in the bottom.

If not, put back in the tin and bake for another 5 minutes. Remove the loaf from the tin and transfer to a wire rack. Leave to cool completely. COTTAGE LOAF MAKES 1 LARGE LOAF Traditionally, bakers used to bake what were called 'oven bottom breads' on the floor of the oven in order to get a heavier, tastier crust. At home, we bake such loaves on a tray and the recipe can be formed into any shape you like- cob, bloomer or, as here, into a classic cottage loaf. Make sure you shape the loaf well so it rises and holds without the help of a loaf tin . 500g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting 5g instant dried yeast 7gfine salt 50g lard, cut into small pieces, softened About 350ml cold water Oil, for oiling ..... Put the flour into a large bowl and add the yeast to one side and the salt to the other. Add the lard and pour in about three-quarters of the water. Turn the mixture around with the fingers of one hand to mix then continue to add more of the water, a little at a time, until all the flour is incorporated. The dough needs to be soft but not soggy. (You may not need all the water or you may need a little more; it depends on the flour.) Tip the dough onto a lightly oiled surface and knead for 5-10 minutes, working through the initial wet stage until it is smooth and silky. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a clean tea towel and leave to rise until doubled in size. This will take at least an hour and can take 2-3 hours or longer, depending on the room temperature. Line a baking tray with baking parchment. Tip the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and fold it inwards repeatedly until all the air is knocked out. At this stage, you're starting to form the structure of the dough so it rises upwards rather than spreading outwards. This is especially important in a free-standing loafwithout a tin to support the bread's rise. Tear off a third of the dough and set aside. Shape the larger piece into a ball. To do this, first flatten the dough into a rough rectangle then roll it up into a thick oblong. Repeat this several times, getting the dough nice and tight. Now fold the two ends in towards the centre and press them down, so you end up with a chunky, squarish shape. Turn the dough over, so that the join is underneath. Continued overleaf BEGINNER ' S BREAD 76 With your palms turned upwards, put your hands on each side, slightly under the dough. Move the cob around, slightly pushing the dough neatly under itself as it turns. You are gently forcing the sides of the dough down and underneath, to create a smooth, taut top. Try to avoid using too much extra flour during shaping if you can. Slightly flatten the ball of dough and place on the prepared baking tray. Shape the other piece of dough into a smaller ball, using the same technique, and flatten slightly. Place the smaller ball on top of the larger ball. Dust your middle finger and forefinger with flour and push them through the centre of the loaf all the way to the bottom. This helps to join the two pieces firmly together. Use a sharp knife to make vertical slashes at even intervals around the top and lower parts of the loaf. Place the tray inside a large, clean plastic bag and leave the dough to prove for at least an hour, or until well risen. When prodded lightly with your finger, the dough should spring back quickly. Don't rush this stage; if the shaped loaf is under-proved it can spring up in the oven and tip over. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 220°C/ Gas 7. Remove the proved loaf from the bag and dust with flour. Bake for 15 minutes, then lower the oven setting to 190°C/ Gas 5 and bake for a further 20-25 minutes, until crusty and golden brown. When tapped on the bottom, the loaf should sound hollow. If not, put it back into the oven for another 5 minutes. Transfer the cooked loaf to a wire rack to cool. BEGINNER'S BREAD 78 GRANA YSTICKS MAKES 6 Granary (or malted) flour changed the way people thought ofbread when it became popular in the seventies and eighties. It is essentially white flour with added flakes of malted wheat, and a nutty flavour. We called these 'sticks' in the bakeries where I worked because they are long, thin rolls, like mini- baguettes. You'll need to make the dough a day ahead, as it has along, slow rise. Olive oil, for oiling 150g strongwhite bread flour, plus extra for dusting 225g granary (malted) flour 5g instant dried yeast 7gfinesalt 350ml cold water Lightly oil a 2- 3litre rectangular or square plastic container, such as an ice-cream tub. (It's important to use this type of container as it helps shape the dough and improve its structure.) Put the flours into a food mixer fitted with the dough hook. (As this dough is wet and tricky to handle, and needs along knead, it's far easier to use a mixer.) Add the yeast to one side and the salt to the other. Start mixing on a slow speed, then slowly add the water. As the dough starts to come together, continue to mix on a slow speed for 5 minutes and then increase the speed to medium and mix for a further 10- 15 minutes or until you have a glossy, elastic dough. The dough should be very elastic and when pulled it should stretch so it's almost transparent without breaking. If it breaks, continue to mix for another 5 minutes. Tip the dough into the prepared tub, cover with a clean tea towel and leave it to rise in the fridge for 24 hours. Line two baking trays with baking parchment, or use a bread stick tray. Coat the work surface with a little olive oil then carefully tip the dough onto it. Rather than knocking it back, handle the dough gently so you keep as much air in as possible. This helps to create the irregular, airy texture of a really good baguette. The dough will be wet to the touch but still lively. Divide the dough into 6 pieces. Shape each piece into an oblong by flattening the dough out slightly and folding the sides up into the middle. Then roll up each piece into a sausage -the top should be smooth with ajoin running along the length of the base. Beginning in the middle, roll out each sausage with your hands to lengthen it. Don't force the dough to elongate by pressing heavily. BEGINNER'S BREAD 80 Concentrate on the backwards and forwards movement and gently use the weight of your arms to roll out the dough to about 15cm in length; the sticks should be about Scm in diameter. Lay the bread sticks on the prepared trays and place each tray inside a large, clean plastic bag. Leave to prove in the fridge for 24 hours. The long proving time helps the dough to develop more flavour. Heat your oven to 220°C/Gas 7 and put a roasting tin in the bottom of the oven to heat up. Remove the trays from the bags and dust the bread sticks lightly with more white flour . Carefully pour enough hot water into the roasting tin in the oven to almost fill it- this will create steam. Bake the granary sticks for 20 minutes or until they are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped on the bottom. Transfer to a wire racK: to cool. MILK LOAF MAKES 1 LARGE LOAF With its soft crumb and rich taste, this loafis popular in theN orth and has always been a firm favourite in my family. Traditionally, it's made in a cylindrical tin marked with round circles, which helps prevent a thick crust forming and gives a soft, springy loaf. ----------------------~------------~----~------~··~--------------- 500g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting 7g instant dried yeast 7gfinesalt 60g unsalted butter, cut into small pieces, softened About 340ml whole milk Oil, for oiling Put the flour in a large bowl and add the yeast to one side and the salt to the other. Add the butter and pour in about three-quarters of the milk. Turn the mixture around with the fingers of one hand to mix. Continue to add more of the milk until all the flour is incorporated. The dough needs to be soft but not soggy. (You may not need all the milk or you may need a little more; it depends on the flour.) Tip the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it for 5-10 minutes until you have a smooth dough. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover and leave to rise until doubled in size.

Put the tin inside a large, clean plastic bag and leave to prove until the dough has doubled in size and springs back quickly when lightly prodded with a finger. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Remove the proved loaf from the bag. If using a milk loaf tin, place the other half of the tin on top and close. Bake the loaf for 30-35 minutes, until golden brown. Remove the loaf from the tin and place on a wire rack. Leave to cool completely.

This one has roasted garlic within the dough as well as plenty of garlic butter. You can make the dough by hand but it is wet and difficult to handle, plus it requires a long knead, so I'd recommend using a food mixer if you can. You'll need to prepare the dough a day ahead as it needs along, slow rise. lOOml olive oil, plus extra for oiling 6 garlic cloves, peeled 250gstrongwhite bread flour, plus extra for dusting 5g instant dried yeast 5gfinesalt 160ml cold water For the garlic butter 175gunsalted butter, softened 4 garlic cloves, roughly chopped A small bunch or packet offtat-leafparsley (28g), leaves picked Salt and black pepper Lightly oil a 2-3litre square or rectangular plastic container, such as an ice-cream tub (a straight-sided container is important as it helps shape the dough). Put the olive oil and peeled whole garlic cloves into a small pan over a low heat and simmer gently for 15-20 minutes, until soft but not coloured. Remove the garlic with a slotted spoon and set aside to cool. Put the flour into a food mixer fitted with the dough hook. Add the yeast to one side and the salt to the other and begin mixing on a slow speed. Now gradually add the water. As the dough starts to come together, add the cooled garlic cloves and continue to mix on a slow speed for 5 minutes. Increase the speed to medium and mix for a further 10 minutes until you have a glossy, very elastic dough. When pulled, the dough should stretch so it's almost transparent without breaking. If it breaks, continue to mix for another 5 minutes. Tip the dough into the prepared tub, cover and leave to prove in the fridge for 24 hours. Line a baking tray with baking parchment, or use a baguette tray. Coat the work surface with a little olive oil and then carefully tip the dough onto it. Rather than knocking it back, handle the dough gently so you keep in as much air as possible. This will help to create the irregular, airy texture of a really good baguette. The dough will be wet to the touch but still lively. Divide the dough in half. Shape each piece into an oblong by flattening the dough out slightly and folding the sides up into the middle.

Slide the tray ofbread into the oven and bake for 20 minutes, until the baguettes are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped on the bottom. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. For the garlic butter, place all the ingredients in a food processor and mix until smooth. To turn the baguettes into garlic bread, have your oven at 180°C/Gas 4. Make vertical cuts three-quarters of the way down into one baguette, at 4cm intervals (make sure you don't cut all the way through). Spread garlic butter into the gaps between the slices and then all over the surface of the baguette. Repeat with the other baguette. Wrap each baguette in foil and bake for 15 minutes. Open the foil fully then bake for a further 5 minutes to crisp the bread. Photographs overleaf BEGINNER'S BREAD 87 CARAMELISED ONION SODA BREAD MAKES 1 LOAF I love soda bread and I really like a good onion-flavoured loaf. The beauty of soda bread is that it's so simple to make, and with no proving required you achieve quick results. Adding extra flavours to a basic soda loaf, as I have done here, takes it to another level. ----------------------~----------------~-------~----------------- 1 tbsp sunflower oil 15gunsalted butter 2 onions, finely sliced 1 tbsp soft dark brown sugar 2 bushy sprigs of thyme, leaves picked 1 tsp fine salt, plus a pinch for the onions 250g plain white flour, plus extra for dusting 250g plain wholemeal flour 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda 400ml buttermilk Heat the oil and butter in a large frying pan. Once the butter has melted, add the onions and stir to coat. Cook slowly over a low heat, stirring occasionally, for about 20 minutes until the onions are softened. Add the sugar, thyme and a pinch of salt. Continue to cook until the onions turn golden brown, stirring occasionally to stop them burning. Tip onto a plate and leave to cool. Heat your oven to 200°C/Gas 6 and line a large baking tray with baking parchment. Put both flours into a large bowl with the salt and bicarbonate of soda and mix well. Make a well in the centre and add the caramelised onions and half the buttermilk. Use the fingers of one hand (or a round-bladed knife and then your fingers) to draw the flour into the buttermilk. Continue to add the buttermilk until all the flour has been incorporated and you have a sticky, malleable dough. You may not need all the buttermilk (depending on the flour- different brands absorb slightly more or less liquid). Tip the dough onto a floured surface, shape into a ball and flatten slightly. Place on the prepared baking tray. Use a large sharp knife to mark the loaf into quarters, cutting deeply into the dough but not quite through the base. Dust the top of the loaf with flour. Bake for 30-35 minutes until the loaf is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the base. You can carefully cut along one of the seams to see if the inside is cooked through; if not, put the loafback in the oven for 5 minutes or so. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Soda bread is best eaten on the day it is made, or at least within a day or two. It also freezes well. BEGINNER'S BREAD 90 STILTON & WALNUT SODA BREAD MAKES 1 LOAF Adding extra flavours to bread dough is popular these days but it was rare when I started out. Blue cheese works well in all types ofbread and becomes even more special when combined with walnuts in this savoury soda bread. 500g plain white flour, plus extra for dusting 1 tsp fine salt 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda 100g walnut pieces 200g Stilton, crumbled 400mlbuttermilk Heat your oven to 200°C/Gas 6 and line a large baking tray with baking parchment. Put the flour, salt and bicarbonate of soda into a large bowl and mix well. Add the walnuts and Stilton and stir gently. Make a well in the centre of the mixture and pour in half the buttermilk. Using the fingers of one hand (or a round-bladed knife and then your fingers), draw the flour into the buttermilk. Continue to add the buttermilk until all the flour has been incorporated and you have a sticky dough.

BEGINNER'S BREAD 93 ROQUEFO T &ALMOND SOURDOUGH MAKES 1 LA RGE LO AF I used to supply this bread to Harrods and atthe time it hit the headlines as 'the most expensive bread in Britain', selling at £25 per loaf. To be fair, it was a big 2kg loaf- and the salty-sweet mix ofblue cheese and nuts does turn humble bread into a star turn. A banneton- a special wicker proving basket - is especially useful for wetter doughs such as sourdoughs, to keep the shape and lift. You will need to prepare the starter a few days ahead. ------·_.--------------------·--------~~--_.~------~~~~uw--~----~----- For the sourdough starter 250g strongwhite bread flour 6 organic, seedless green grapes, chopped 250mlwater To refresh the starter (each time) lOOgstrongwhite bread flour lOOmlwater For the loaf Oil, for oiling 375g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting 200g sourdough starter (see above) 7gfinesalt About 175ml water lOOg Roquefort, crumbled into small pieces 125g blanched almonds, chopped medium-fine Fine semolina, for dusting To prepare the starter, in a bowl. mix the flour with the grapes and water. Transfer this mixture to a Kilner jar, close the lid and leave to ferment at warm room temperature (ideally 20-24°C). After 2-3 days the mixture should have started to grow and look lively, with bubbles on the surface. Once the mixture is active, discard half of it then add lOOg flour and lOOml water. This process is called 'feeding' the mixture and should be repeated every few days for as long as you have your starter. (You can keep a starter dormant between loaves by storing it in the fridge, bringing it back to room temperature and starting the feeding process again before using it.) After the starter has been fed, leave it for a day and the mixture should become thicker and have ajelly-like texture. Once at this stage it is ready to use. For the loaf, lightly oil a 2-3litre square or rectangular plastic container, such as an ice-cream tub. Mix the flour, starter and salt together in a large bowl then mix in just enough water to form a soft dough, using a spoon first, then your hands. Lightly oil your work surface, tip the dough onto it and knead for at least 10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Place the dough in the oiled plastic container and cover with cling film. Leave to rise until doubled in size. This can take up to 5 hours or longer, depending on the temperature and the vigour of your starter. Continued overleaf BEGINNER'S BREAD 94 When the dough is ready, mix equal quantities of flour and semolina together in a small bowl and use to dust your work surface generously. Gently tip the dough onto the surface and flatten into a rectangle. Scatter the cheese and chopped almonds over the surface then fold the dough in on itself a few times to incorporate them. Flatten the dough into a rectangle again and bring the sides into the middle to meet, so you get a chunky squareish shape. Turn the dough over so the join is now on the bottom. Shape the dough into a ball by cupping it with the sides of your hands and turning it around to create a smooth ball. (This is looser than a standard bread dough and so more difficult to handle; you can dust your hands with flour to make the task less sticky.) Dust a round banneton basket or a medium bowl liberally with flour or the flour and semolina mix. Add the ball of dough, inverting it so that it sits smooth side down. Put inside a large, clean plastic bag and leave to prove until doubled in size. This is likely to take somewhere between 4 and 8 hours, possibly even longer. Don't rush this stage; it's important for developing the flavour and structure of the loaf. Heat your oven to 220°C/ Gas 7 and put a roasting tin in the bottom to heat up. Heavily dust a baking tray with the flour and semolina mix. Tip the bread onto the tray and use a scalpel or sharp knife to slash a 2cm deep cross on the top. Carefully pour enough hot water into the roasting tin in the oven to almost fill it- this will create steam. Put the bread into the oven and bake for 20 minutes, then lower the oven setting to 200°C/ Gas 6 and bake for a further 15 minutes. The loaf should be dark brown and sound hollow when tapped on the base. If not, put it back in the oven for another 5 minutes. Transfer the cooked loaf to a wire rack and leave to cool. BEGINNER'S BREAD 96 CRUMPETS MAKES ABOUT 10 Crumpets get their texture from two different rising stages: first a rise with yeast, then one with bicarbonate of soda to create the characteristic holes. Slow cooking on a griddle or in aheavyfryingpan gives the crumpets their brown base and flavour. They take a little practice to perfect; in particular, keep an eye on the heat throughout cooking. I've also included a tangy rarebit topping (overleaf) that turns them into a meal. 175gstrongwhite bread flour 175g plain white flour 14g instant dried yeast 1 tsp caster sugar 350rnl warm whole milk About 200rnl cold water Y. tsp bicarbonate of soda ltsp fine salt Sunflower oil, for cooking Put both flours into a large bowl and mix in the yeast. In a jug, dissolve the sugar in the warm milk, then pour onto the flour mixture. Use a wooden spoon to draw the dry ingredients into the liquid, then beat until the mixture forms a smooth batter. Beat the batter for a further 3minutes. Cover the bowl with a tea towel and leave to stand for 1 hour. The mixture will rise and then begin to fall- you will see marks on the side of the bowl where the batter reached before it dropped. This indicates that the yeast has created its carbon dioxide and is now exhausted. The gluten will have developed sufficiently to give the crumpets the structure to rise and hold their shape. In a jug, mix 150rnl water with the bicarbonate of soda and salt. Stir this into the batter until evenly combined, then gradually stir in as much of the remaining water as necessary to get a thick dropping consistency. Cover the bowl and leave the batter to rest for about 20 minutes. Small holes will appear on the surface and the batter will become a bit sticky. Heat a flat griddle or heavy-based frying pan over a medium-low heat. Lightly but thoroughly grease the inside of at least four 7 -Scm metal crumpet rings (ideally non-stick). Lightly grease the griddle or pan, using a crumpled kitchen paper dipped in oil. It's a good idea to start with a trial crumpet to get used to the heat of the pan and how your batter will cook (the first one is never the best, like the first pancake). Put a greased crumpet ring on the griddle or in the frying pan. Ladle enough batter into it to come just below the top of the ring. Continued overleaf BEGINNER'S BREAD 98 ---- --- - ---- - -~ After 6-8 minutes, the bottom of the crumpet should be browned and the rest almost cooked through. The top of the crumpet will be drier and almost set, and most of the bubbles on the top will have burst. You can slightly speed up the cookingbypoppingthese bubbles as they appear, with a skewer or the sharp tip of a knife; when the crumpet is ready, the bubbles will stay open rather than fill up with liquid batter. Turn the crumpet over carefully, using a spatula and a palette knife. Leave the crumpet to cook for a few more minutes then lift it out onto a wire rack. Run a small, sharp knife around the outside of the crumpet to loosen it and remove from the ring. Now you know the time and temperature needed for your batter, you are ready to cook the rest of the crumpets, in batches. CRUMPETS WITH RAREBIT TOPPING Have a batch of crumpets cooked and ready. For the rarebit topping, put 2 tbsp plain flour, 1% tsp mustard powder, 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce, 125ml milk or beer and 185g grated strong Cheddar into a saucepan. Bring to the boil, stirring, over a medium heat. Lower the heat and simmer until thickened and smooth, stirring constantly. Pour into a bowl and beat in 2 medium egg yolks. Cover with cling film and leave to cool, then refrigerate until needed. The rarebit will firm up once cold. Heat your grill to high. Toast the crumpets on both sides then place on a baking tray. Spread the rarebit on top of the crumpets and place under the grill until bubbling and golden brown. Eat at once. BEGINNER'S BREAD 100 • ENGLISH MUFFINS MAKES 8 A good English muffin- simply cut, toasted and buttered- is a thing ofbeauty, particularly if it's home-made. I used to make muffins for Eggs Benedict when I worked in hotels, and through doing this I discovered that the secret to good muffins is getting the heat just right and adjusting it as you cook. 300g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting 5g instant dried yeast ltsp fine salt 1 tbsp caster sugar 20g unsalted butter, cut into small pieces, softened 1 medium egg, beaten About 200rnl whole milk Oil, for oiling Fine semolina, for dusting Put the flour into a large bowl and add the yeast to one side and the salt to the other. Add the sugar, butter, egg and three-quarters of the milk. Turn the mixture around with the fingers of one hand to mix then continue to add more of the remaining milk until all the flour is incorporated. The dough needs to be soft but not soggy. (You may not need all the milk or you may need a little more; it depends on the flour.) Tip the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it for 5-10 minutes, until smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a clean tea towel and leave to rise for an hour or until doubled in size. Line two baking trays with baking parchment. Mix equal quantities of flour and semolina together in a small bowl and use to lightly dust your work surface. Tip the dough onto the surface and roll out to about a 2.3cm thickness. You don't want the muffins to be too thick or they will overcook on the outside before cooking properly within. Use an 8.5cm plain cutter to stamp out 8 rounds. Put these on the prepared tray and sprinkle the tops with a little semolina. Place each tray in a large, clean plastic bag and leave to prove for about an hour, or until risen slightly. Remove from the bags. Heat a heavy-based frying pan or griddle over a low heat. Wipe the surface with an oiled piece of scrunched-up kitchen paper. Cook the muffins, two at a time, for 5-6 minutes on each side until golden; wipe the pan with oiled kitchen paper as necessary between batches. Place the muffins on a wire rack and leave to cool completely. Slice in half and toast before serving with butter. BEGINNER'S BREAD 103 FRUIT DOUGHNUTS MAKES 20 I like to keep doughnuts simple, without fancy icing. This version uses three kinds of fresh fruit instead of jam and is slightly less sweetthan usual. For the dough 500gstrongwhite bread flour, plus extra for dusting 50g caster sugar lOg instant dried yeast 7gfinesalt 140ml warm whole milk 5 medium eggs 250gunsalted butter, cut into small pieces, softened, plus extra for greasing For the filling 50g raspberries 50g blueberries 1 fig, cut into small pieces To cook and finish Sunflower oil, for deep-frying Caster sugar, for dredging Put the flour and sugar into a food mixer fitted with the dough hook and add the yeast to one side and the salt to the other. Add the milk and eggs and mix for about 8 minutes until smooth. Knead the dough on a slow speed for 5 minutes then add the butter, piece by piece, scraping down the side of the bowl from time to time. Once it is all incorporated and the dough is smooth and sticky, increase the speed and knead for a further 6 minutes. Tip the dough into a lightly greased large bowl, cover and refrigerate overnight. Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knock back by folding the dough inwards repeatedly to expel the air. Weigh the dough and divide it into 20 equal pieces (55-60g each). Roll each piece into a ball between the palms of your hands and flatten out a little. In the middle of each piece, place a couple of raspberries, a few blueberries or a few fig pieces. Form the dough into a ball around the fruit, making sure it is well sealed. Roll each one lightly but firmly into a smooth ball by placing it in a cage formed by your cupped hand on the work surface and moving your hand around in a circular motion. Place the balls on a lightly floured tray, cover loosely with cling film and leave to prove for an hour, or until doubled in size. When you are ready to cook, heat the oil in a deep-fryer, or a deep, heavy saucepan (no more than one-third full) to 180°C, or until a cube ofbread dropped in browns in a minute. You will need to cook the doughnuts 2 or 3 at a time. Gently lower them into the hot oil and fry, turning with tongs every few minutes to ensure they cook evenly. The doughnuts colour quickly, but need 10-12 minutes to cook through, when they'll puff up and float. Keep the oil at a constant temperature. Remove the doughnuts with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. Dredge with sugar while they are still hot and serve as soon as they are cool enough to eat. These doughnuts will keep for a day or two, but they are best eaten soon after they are cooked. BEGINNER'S BREAD 104 CHEESE CRACKERS MAKES 14 These spicy cheese crackers are gluten-free, a way ofbakingthatis much more in demand than when I started out, and so a useful recipe to have to hand. 75g strong Cheddar, finely grated 50g ground almonds 1 tbsp cornflour ~ tsp baking powder A pinch each of celery salt, garlic salt, paprika and white pepper (less than ~ tsp of each) 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce Y. tsp runny honey 2 tsp cold water Put the cheese, ground almonds, cornflour, baking powder and dry seasonings into a bowl and mix together. Add the Worcestershire sauce, honey and 1 tsp water. Squeeze and work the mixture until it comes together, adding the remaining water if required. You want the dough to be firm but malleable. Place the dough on a large sheet ofbaking parchment paper on your work surface and press it out into a rectangle, of even thickness. Place another sheet of parchment on top. Roll out the dough between the parchment until it is about16 x 27cm and 2-3mm thick. Remove the top piece of parchment and mark the dough into 14 rectangles with a knife, without cutting right through. Lift the dough on its sheet of parchment onto a baking tray and place in the fridge to rest for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 170°C/Gas 3 Y.. Bake for 12-15 minutes, until the crackers are turning brown. Take out the tray and lower the oven setting to 100°C/Gas 't:t. While the crackers are still hot, cut along the marked lines to separate them. Once the oven has cooled to the correct temperature, return the tray to the oven for 10 minutes to dry out the crackers a little. Transfer the crackers to a wire rack and leave to cool completely. Store in an airtight container. BEGINNER'S BREAD 106 LAVROCHE MAKES 30 Lavroche is a crisp wafer bread that's great with cheese at the end of a meal, or served with pre-dinner drinks, on its own or with a spread or a dip such as hummus. When I used to do big batches in hotel bakeries, we would make it in massive sheets that you'd pass through a rolling machine, but at home you can use a rolling pin to do the same job. 190g strong white bread flour 75gfine semolina ltsp fine salt ltbsp olive oil About 75ml water 40mlmilk 1 medium egg, beaten, to glaze 1 tbsp linseeds (also known as flaxseed) lOg Gruyere, finely grated lOg Parmesan, finely grated 1 tsp fennel seeds 1 tsp caraway seeds Put the flour, semolina and salt into a bowl and stir to combine. Add the olive oil, water and milk and mix to bring the ingredients together. Add a little more water if necessary; you want the mixture to be dry but pliable. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it for 5 minutes until smooth. Wrap in cling film and leave to rest in the fridge for 30 minutes. Line two baking trays with baking parchment. Roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface to a very thin square, about 35 x 35cm. Brush off any excess flour. Trim the edges of the dough to neaten then cut into 3 strips, each about 30 x 9cm. Brush the dough strips with beaten egg. Coat one with linseeds, another with the grated cheeses and the third with the fennel and caraway seeds. Cut each strip of dough into 10 small triangles. Place the triangles on the prepared baking trays and rest in the fridge for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 220°C/Gas 7. Bake the lavroche triangles for about 15 minutes until they are crisp and browned. BEGINNER'S BREAD 109 ·n,. h~'l ·r ,r ,,. '\"''r ,\\t\\l'rt' '' 'h'•' . \\ •n\\l . . I HOTEL SECRETS . ... . . ·.. .. ' '' . .. / ,; / , / , . •• ,------------------------------------------------------·---· AS A TEENAGER, I WAS LUCKY enoughtogowithmydad to some good restaurants. It was at the Chester Grosvenor that I first saw a bread trolley in a Michelin-starred restaurant. I thought: this is interesting. And I also thought: the bread's okay, but it could be better. At the age of twenty-one, I finished working for my dad and applied for a job at the Chester Grosvenor. It's a city centre hotel in a Grade lllisted, black-and-white timbered building. Beautifully decorated inside, you always feel you are somewhere really special there. As a hotel baker, I learnt a whole new range of skills and recipes. My ingredients were more expensive, I had more time and I could experiment. There were all these dainty little things that you might find in a Paris patisserie - so easy to eat and gorgeous. Before working there, I'd never made Danish pastries or croissants- there was little call for croissants in a high -street bakery in the early eighties; if you wanted to eat croissants, you went to France. The head baker taught me his recipes before he left and I've refined them over the years, partly by working with other French pastry chefs, and partly in order to make them more accessible for the home baker. The main lesson I learnt is that a little effort can make a great difference, whether it's a plate of scones or a refined French tart. Working in high-street bakeries, you'd say, 'That'll do' and get away with it. But in hotels, everything has to be consistent and everything has to look perfect. In a normal bakery, when you make scones, say, they are probably 2-3 inches high- quite lumpy scones- because people want to get value for their money. But in a hotel, that's not the case; they want finesse. One of the keys to a smart afternoon tea is keeping everything the same size. That was always critical- from the sandwiches to FIVE-STAR BAKING 112 I the scone to the petits fours, barquettes and meringues. Quality and presentation matter. Scones are easy to make so it's what you serve them with - good jam, butter, cream and tea- that sets a scone apart. The standards in a hotel kitchen are rigorous. Each day, the executive chef would get the least successful breakfast dishes put onto a plate and brought into his office. If anything wasn't good enough, he'd call me in, as head baker. I'd be criticised if a roll was a touch more tanned or if a Danish pastry was slightly raw. It tended to happen because some of the ovens weren't the best, but everything had to be perfect and you couldn't just blame your tools. At the Grosvenor, I nearly gave up my baking career. I said to the chef, 'I'm alright at baking but I've been doing it for years and I want to be a chef.' So he moved me into hors d'oeuvres, then veg, then sauces, and finally mise en place, where you plate up the food. I did that for many months, moving around the kitchen and learning from the chefs and sous-chefs. I learnt to butcher the meat, to gut and prepare a fish. The chef wanted to make the most of my baking skills, so I ended up doing two jobs for a while and working a twelve-hour day. Finally, I said, 'I want to give up the baking and become a full-time chef.' Then he told me the salary. No chance. I went back to full-time baking. However, the experience of working as a cheffor a while gave my baking another dimension. I learnt knife skills that helped me to prepare ingredients for breads and pastries, and it really opened up the world offood, introducing me to flavours and textures I had never encountered before. I would find myself thinking that I could use this or that ingredient in a loaf or on top of a cake, and that became part of my craft. Cooking and baking are different skills but there's a crossover between them that helps a baker to be more creative. FIVE-STAR BAKING 113 ~-------- -- --- -- - - -- -- Next came London. At the age of twenty-four, I became the youngest head baker the Dorchester Hotel had ever had. It's one of the most prestigious five-star hotels in the world, in the centre ofLondon by Hyde Park, and guests come from all over the world to enjoy its thirties' glamour. The staff had a separate entrance down Deanery Street. You'd scan your card and go down to a beautiful kitchen the size of five tennis courts, with the latest equipment, and all of us in brand new uniforms. I'd work ten days and have only two or three days off. I couldn't go back home all that much and I missed my friends and family. In the end I thought: 'London's not for me.' I went up North again, to work at the Chester Grosvenor for another two years. The final chapter in my hotel years came when I worked at Cliveden. This was after I'd been working abroad in Cyprus for six years and it was a return that took me to the heart of the English countryside. You'd swear you were in the middle of nowhere but in fact you are only half an hour's drive from London. As you turn into this gravel drive you see one of the most beautiful stately homes in the country; it's been in many, many films. Ittakes a good five minutes to get to the top of the drive, and when you step into the hotel's grand hallway you'll be greeted by a suit of armour, tapestries on the walls and a huge formal staircase. But the thing I love about Cliveden is that it's still like being in someone's home, and you feel as though you should be there. There was a big snooker room down in the cellar, next to the bakery. I'd go in there when I was in between bakes, or when things were proving, and my snooker improved vastly. The place was beautiful but I have to say that it was also quite creepy at night when I was up baking and everyone else was asleep- I probably looked like a ghost, covered in white flour. Looking back, why did I make the move from the high street to hotel baking? Why did I go for the job ofhead baker at the FIVE-STAR BAKING 115 Dorchester when I reached the age of twenty-four? It's always the challenge. I knew that ifl didn't go for a job, I'd kick myselflater. Stretch yourself, and you become a better baker. Some of the recipes in this chapter are straightforward but have small touches that make them 'five star'. Others are more complex, such as the seasonal Danish pastries on page 118 and the ham and cheese croissants on page 156. These require time and attention but I'd encourage any baker to give them a go. If you can make a bread, you can make a croissant dough. On paper, the recipe seems to go on for ever and ever. But when you break it down, it's not hard. It's really just dough, with layers of butter in between -that's it. Use a good French butter and that will make all the difference. If you choose a high -quality butter and take your time with the folding, you'll end up with something that's up to professional standards. If you push yourself, you'll always find that actually it's not that difficult. Shortcrust pastry is also a matter of practice. It's key to get the fat and sugar to a fine crumb, before adding your egg yolk or water. Once the liquid goes in, mix it together with your hands, pushing and binding it together gently. Don't be tempted to add more liquid, as you'll knead the mixture too much and make it rubbery. Bring the dough together, wrap it in cling film and rest in the fridge for 30 minutes or so. If you make the pastry well ahead, you'll need to let it soften a little at room temperature before using it, or you'll struggle to roll it out without cracking. You can also roll your pastry out between a couple of sheets ofbaking parchment or cling film to stop it sticking to the work surface. If you stretch yourself then you'll always enjoy the rewards. As well as the satisfaction of making something well, you have much more control over what you're eating. Many commercial croissants and pastries use margarine rather than butter as the fat, for example. Bake them yourself and you know what goes into them. That way you'll be eating the best. FIVE-STAR BAKING 116 SEASONAL DANISH PASTRIES MAKES 15 Danish pastry dough is versatile and can be used to make all kinds of breakfast pastries. To achieve the layering of the dough and butter takes time -around 12 hours of chilling between folding and rolling- but the hands-on work isn't laborious. These luxurious pastries are filled with raspberries but you can use other fruits that suit the season- blackberries or apple for autumn, apricots in the summer, or even bananas all year round. For the dough 450gstrongwhite bread flour, plus extra for dusting 7g instant dried yeast 7gfine salt 75g caster sugar 2 medium eggs 75ml cold water 100ml whole milk 225g unsalted butter (ideally a good-quality Normandy butter), softened For the creme patissiere 250ml whole milk 1 vanilla pod, split lengthways 2 medium egg yolks 50g caster sugar 1 Y. tbsp cornflour 20gunsalted butter, cut into small dice To assemble 1 egg, beaten, to glaze 150g raspberries 75g apricot jam, to finish Put the flour into a food mixer fitted with the dough hook. Add the yeast to one side and the salt and sugar to the other and begin mixing on a slow speed. Add the eggs, water and milk and mix for a couple of minutes to bring the dough together. Increase the speed and mix for a further 5 minutes. (You can make this dough by hand but I would recommend using a mixer if possible.) Tip the dough onto a lightly floured surface and form into a ball. Wrap in cling film and rest in the fridge for 1 hour. Press the dough out on a lightly floured surface with your knuckles, then stretch to a rough rectangle. Now roll out to a smooth rectangle, 45 x 20cm, to end up with a short side facing you. The dough can be quite hard to stretch because it wants to pull back into shape; one tip is to press the sides down onto the work surface to help hold the dough as you roll. Spread the butter out to cover the bottom two-thirds of the dough; make sure it is in an even layer and comes almost to the edges. Fold the exposed dough down to cover half of the butter. Fold the bottom half of the buttered dough up and over, then seal the dough by gently squeezing the edges together. Wrap in cling film and refrigerate for at least an hour, until the butter has hardened. Unwrap the chilled dough, place it on a lightly floured surface and roll again into a rectangle, 45 x 20cm, with a short side facing you. Fold the bottom third of the dough up and the top third down on top. This is called 'a single turn'. Wrap the dough in cling film and place in the fridge for an hour. Repeat this stage twice more, chilling the dough between turns. Write the number ofturns on the cling film with a marker pen, as a reminder. Continued overleaf FIVE-STAR BAKING 118 Your dough now needs to be wrapped in cling film and chilled for at least 8 hours, or overnight, to rest and rise slightly. To make the creme patissiere, pour the milk into a saucepan. Scrape out the seeds from the vanilla pod and add them to the milk with the empty pod. Slowly bring to the boil. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, beat the egg yolks with the sugar and cornflour. A15 soon as the milk comes to the boil, remove the vanilla pod and pour the milk onto the egg mix, whisking as you do so. Pour back into the pan and heat gently, stirring all the time, until the custard thickens. Pour the creme patissiere into a clean bowl and stir in the butter. Cover the surface closely with cling film to prevent a skin forming and leave to cool, then place in the fridge. Line three baking trays with baking parchment. Unwrap the chilled dough and roll out on a lightly floured surface to a 35cm square. Trim the edges to straighten. Cut the dough into 15 strips, flouring the knife from time to time to stop it sticking. Twist each strip in opposite directions from both ends and tie in a knot then tuck the ends under to form a circle. Place the pastries on the prepared baking trays, leaving enough space in between for them to expand. Put each tray inside a large, clean plastic bag and leave to prove for 2 hours, or until doubled in size. Heat your oven to 200°C/ Gas 6. Take the trays out of the bags. Gently ease open the centre of each knot to make more space and put a spoonful of creme patissiere in the middle. Brush the pastries with beaten egg to glaze and bake for 15-20 minutes, until risen and golden. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. Before serving, place the fruit on top of the creme patissiere. Warm the apricot jam and brush on the pastries to give them a final glaze. Photographs overleaf FIVE-STAR BAKING 121 . . - DOUBLE CHOCOLATE DANISH TWISTS MAKES 6 I like to play around with different types of chocolate for Danish pastries, even putting cut-up Mars Bars and Snickers inside. Hazelnut chocolate spread, such as N utella, is twisted inside these pastries and they are topped with white chocolate. It's breaking the rules, but it works. The technique for rolling and folding the Danish pastry dough is illustrated on page 119; remember that you'll need to allow plenty of time for chilling the dough- 450g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting 7ginstantdriedyeast 7gfine salt 75g caster sugar 2 medium eggs 75ml cold water lOOml whole milk 225gunsalted butter (ideally a good-quality Normandy butter), softened For the filling and topping 150g chocolate spread lOOg good-qualitywhite chocolate, cut into small pieces around 12 hours in total.

Repeat this stage twice more, chilling the dough between turns. Write the number of turns on the cling film with a marker pen, as a reminder. Your dough now needs to be wrapped in cling film and chilled for at least 8 hours, or overnight, to rest and rise slightly. Line two baking trays with baking parchment. Unwrap the chilled dough and roll it out on a lightly floured surface to a rectangle, 60 x 30cm. Trim the edges to straighten. Cover the surface of the dough with chocolate spread, leaving about a lcm clear margin along the edges. Fold the dough in halflengthways, to make a rectangle 60 x 15cm. Cut the dough into 6long strips, each 2.5cm wide, flouring the knife from time to time to stop it sticking. Twist each strip in opposite directions from both ends and tie in a knot then tuck the ends under to form a circle. Place the pastries on the prepared baking trays and put each tray inside a large, clean plastic bag. Leave to prove for 2 hours, or until the pastries have doubled in size. Heat your oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Take the baking trays out of the bags. Bake the pastries for 15-20 minutes, until risen and golden. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. Melt the white chocolate in aheatproofbowl over a pan ofbarely simmering water (the bottom of the bowl must not touch the water). Drizzle the melted white chocolate over the cooled pastries and leave to set before serving. Photograph overleaf SULTANA& PECAN SCONE RING MAKES 8 Scones are a hotel afternoon tea staple. Mine once got the approval of Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, who used to come to Cliveden quite often and take tea in Madame de Pompadour's French dining room. I like to use strong bread flour in my scones and in this recipe I've slipped in some lard as well as butter, for a better texture and flavour- a tip I got from my nan. 225g strong white bread flour, plus an extra 25g for dusting ~ tsp fine salt 2 tsp baking powder 20g cold unsalted butter, cut into small dice 20g cold lard, cut into small dice 40g caster sugar 60g golden sultanas 20gpecan nuts, roughly chopped Finely grated zest of !orange lmediumegg 125m! whole milk 1 egg, beaten, to glaze Heat your oven to 220°C/Gas 7. Line a baking tray with baking parchment. Put the 225gflour into a large bowl with the salt and baking powder. Add the butter and lard and rub in with your fingertips until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add the sugar, sultanas, chopped pecans and orange zest and stir to combine. Make a well in the centre and break in the egg. Pour in half of the milk then mix with a wooden spoon until smoothly combined. Mix in the remaining milk, a little at a time, until you have a soft dough- you may not need all of it. Dust your work surface with the 25gflour. Tip the dough onto it and gently fold it repeatedly until the flour is incorporated and the dough is smooth. If the dough is sticky, dust your hands with more flour to make it easier to handle. Shape the dough into a round, 2.5cm thick, and place on the prepared tray. Score the scone round into 8 triangles by cutting deeply into the dough until your knife touches the baking tray. Brush the top with beaten egg. Bake the scone round for 20 minutes, until risen and golden brown. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. Eat warm or cold, cut into 8 wedges, on the same day to enjoy at its best. FIVE-STAR BAKING 128 NICE BISCUITS MAKES 12 -1 5 I do like the classic biscuits and this is my version of one of the best. Thin, crisp and flavoured with coconut, these delicate biscuits are perfect withacuppa. 125gplain flour, plus extra for dusting lOg cold unsalted butter, cut into small dice 50g caster sugar 20g desiccated coconut ~ tsp baking powder 40- SOml milk ~ tsp vanilla extract 1-2 tsp granulated sugar, for sprinkling Put the flour into a large bowl, add the butter and rub in using your fingertips. Add the caster sugar, coconut and baking powder and mix to combine. Add 25rnl of the milk with the vanilla extract and use one hand to bring the mixture together. Add the remaining milk, 1 tsp at a time, until you have a stiff dough that forms a ball; you may not need all the milk or you may need a little more. Wrap in cling film and leave to rest in the fridge for at least 30 minutes. Line a baking tray with baking parchment. Lightlydustyourwork surface with flour and roll out the dough on it to a 3mm thickness. Using a Scm fluted square cutter, stamp out squares. (Alternatively, you could cut straight-sided biscuits using a sharp knife.) Place on the prepared tray, leaving a small space between each one. Re-roll any trimmings and stamp out more squares. Prick the surface of each square with a fork (this stops them rising too much). Place the tray in the fridge to chill for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 190°C/ Gas 5. Just before baking, sprinkle 1 tsp granulated sugar over the surface of the dough squares. Bake for 15 minutes, until the biscuits are pale golden brown and cooked through. Remove from the oven and leave on the tray to firm up for a few minutes then transfer to a wire rack to cool. Sprinkle with a little more sugar before serving, if you wish. FIVE-STAR BAKING 130 JAFFA CAKES MAKES 12 Children- and adults -love these Jaffa Cakes, which are made using a shallow bun tray as a mould. The orange is just that little bit more intense and you can use your choice of chocolate. It's a poshed up version of an all-time favourite, fit for a five-star hotel tea. For thespongebase Unsalted butter, for greasing 25g self-raising flour A pinch of fine salt Ys tsp baking powder !large egg, separated 25g caster sugar Ys tsp cream of tartar For the orange jelly Y. x135gpacketorangejelly 2 tsp orange marmalade 60ml boiling water For the chocolate topping lOOg dark chocolate (60- 70% cocoa solids) 40ml double cream 1 tbsp caster sugar Heat your oven to 180°C/Gas 4 and grease a shallow 12-hole bun tray with butter. For the sponge, sift the flour, salt and baking powder together; set aside. In a medium bowl, using a hand-held electric whisk, beat the egg yolk with half of the sugar until the mixture thickens and turns pale in colour- this will take about 5 minutes. Carefully fold in the flour mixture, using a large metal spoon or spatula. In a clean bowl, whisk the egg white with the cream of tartar until stiff. Gradually add the remaining sugar, whisking well after each addition, then gently fold into the whisked egg and sugar mixture. Divide the mixture evenly between the bun tray moulds and gently smooth the surface to level. Bake for 8- 10 minutes until the sponges are risen and spring back when lightly touched. Leave in the tray for a few minutes then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Wash and dry the bun tray then line the moulds with cling film. Break the jelly into cubes and cut into small pieces. Place in a jug with the marmalade, pour on the boiling water and stir until the jelly has dissolved. Divide between the lined moulds then refrigerate to set. For the topping, break the chocolate into pieces and put into a small pan with the cream and sugar. Warm gently over a low heat until melted. Stir to combine and form a thick silky sauce. Let cool slightly. To assemble, take the jellies from the moulds. For a neat finish, cut each jelly with a small round cutter. Sit each one, rounded side up, on a sponge base and spoon on the chocolate topping to coat. (This must not be too warm or it will melt the jelly layer and slide off. If necessary, let cool for a little longer.) Mark a decorative pattern in the chocolate using a cocktail stick or skewer. Leave to set on a wire rack. FIVE-STAR BAKING 133 FIG ROLLS MA KES 14 An afternoon tea is a great pick-me-up and can be made into a special treat just with a welcome pot of tea and a little plate ofhome-made biscuits like these. You can vary the spices and citrus zest to your taste, and the grated apple adds a little freshness to the dried fruits. For the pastry 200g plain flour Y, tsp baking powder 120g cold unsalted butter, diced A pinch of fine salt 1 tbsp caster sugar 1 medium egg, lightly beaten For the filling 175g dried figs, roughly chopped 50g dates, roughly chopped 75mlwater '!. tsp bicarbonate of soda Finely grated zest and juice of1orange Finely grated zest ofllemon 25g dark muscovado sugar 1 small apple, peeled and coarsely grated % tsp ground cinnamon % tsp freshly grated nutmeg To make the pastry, mix the flour and baking powder together in a large bowl. Add the butter and rub in with your fingertips until the mixture resemble fine breadcrumbs. Add the salt and sugar and mix well. Add the egg and bring the mixture together to form a soft dough. Transfer to a lightly floured surface and gently knead into a smooth ball. Wrap in cling film and place in the fridge to rest. For the filling, put the figs and dates into a small pan with the water, bicarbonate of soda, orange zest and juice, lemon zest and sugar. Heat gently until bubbling and simmer until thick, sticky andjam-like. Set aside to cool, then add the grated apple and spices and mix well. Heat your oven to 190°C/ Gas 5 and line abakingtraywith baking parchment. Roll out the rested pastry on a lightly floured surface to a rectangle, 32 x 25cm and 5mm thick. Trim the edges to straighten. Cut the pastry in half so you have two 30cm long strips. Turn one piece of pastry so the long side is facing you. Spoon half of the sticky fruit filling in a line along this pastry strip, towards the edge closest to you but leaving a lcm clear margin. Brush this pastry edge with water, then bring the other side of the pastry up over the filling and press the edges together to seal. Trim the ends to neaten. Repeat with the remaining strip of pastry, using the rest of the filling. Carefully lift the filled rolls onto the prepared baking tray and score at 4cm intervals, taking care not to cut right through the pastry. Press a fork down onto the top of each roll to mark it and slightly flatten to the classic fig roll shape. Bake for 15-20 minutes, until golden. Leave to cool on the tray for 5 minutes, then cut along the scored marks and transfer the fig rolls to a wire rack to cool completely. FIVE-STAR BAKING 134 CHOCOLATE & ORANGE MINI TARTS MAKES 8 The flavour of the orange really comes through in these special little tarts. Because the chocolate is so rich, you don't want too much so I've made them small enough to eat in a couple ofbites. The gold leaf decoration is a five-star hotel touch but I'd be equally happy with just the chocolate curls, or even a halved fresh orange segment brushed with a bit of apricot jam! For the pastry 100g unsalted butter, softened 50g icing sugar 1 medium egg, beaten 125gplain flour Finely grated zest of 1orange For the filling llOg dark chocolate ( 60-70% cocoa solids) Finely grated zest of 1orange 1 tsp orange blossom water 100ml double cream 20gunsalted butter To decorate 75g dark chocolate ( 60-70% cocoa solids) 1 small sheet edible gold leaf (optional) To make the pastry, beat the butter and icing sugar together in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Gradually incorporate the beaten egg, then add the flour and orange zest and stir until just combined; try not to over-mix. The dough will be very soft at this stage. Form it into a ball, wrap in cling film and chill in the fridge for at least an hour. Heat your oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Have ready 8 fluted mini tarts tins, 6.5cm in diameter and 2cm deep. (Alternatively, you could use a shallow 12-hole bun tray and make 12 slightly smaller tarts.) Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface to a 3mm thickness and cut out 8 rounds, using a 10.5cm plain round cutter (or an Scm cutter if using a bun tray). Use to line the mini tart tins, making sure you push the pastry into the fluted edges; leave the excess overhanging the edges of the tins. Line each pastry case with a small square ofbakingparchment and fill with baking beans. Bake 'blind' for 8 minutes, until the pastry is dry to the touch, then remove the parchment and beans and return the pastry cases to the oven for about 4 minutes until the base is dry and the pastry is very lightly coloured. Let cool, then use a small, sharp knife to trim away the excess pastry from the edge of the tins. Melt 20g of the chocolate (for the filling) in aheatproofbowl over a pan of simmering water, making sure the bottom of the bowl doesn't touch the water. Brush the base of the tarts with the melted chocolate. Leave to set. For the filling, chop the remaining 90g dark chocolate into small pieces with a large knife, or in a food processor, and place in a bowl FIVE-STAR BAKING 136 • • • 0 .. with the orange zest. Put the orange blossom water, cream and butter into a pan and heat sl,owly until the mixture just comes to the boil. Pour onto the choc.olate and stir until it melts to form a smooth, shiny paste. Spoon the filling into the mini tart cases and leave to set (at room temperature). To make the chocolate curls, break the 75g dark chocolate into small pieces and melt in a heatproofbowl over a pan of simmering water (as before), stirring occasionally until smooth. Pour the chocolate onto the centre of a clean baking sheet and use a palette knife to spread it out into a smooth, thin layer. Place in the fridge for about 5-10 minutes, until set but not brittle. Press gently with your fingertip -it should leave a mark but not an indentation. Use the edge of a large, sharp knife to scrape the chocolate away from you: it should curl. If it breaks, the chocolate is too cold so leave it to soften on the work surface for a few minutes then try again. Store the chocolate curls in an airtight box between layers ofbaking parchment until required. (You will have more than you need, but the excess can be frozen.) Before serving, decorate each mini chocolate and orange tart with a few chocolate curls and a little crumpled gold leaf, if you like.

The trick is to whip the meringue properly, so it can hold the nuts well even when they release some of their oils. These meringue fingers are piped, baked, then sandwiched with cream and decorated with chocolate and toasted almonds. In a luxury hotel such as the Grosvenor, they would have been piped perfectly, of course. 4 medium egg whites ){ tsp cream of tartar 170g caster sugar 75g ground almonds 1 tbsp cornflour For the filling and decoration 75g dark chocolate (60-70% cocoa solids), cut into small pieces . 400ml double cream 50gchoppedtoasted almonds Heat your oven to 140°C/Gas 1 and line two baking trays with baking parchment. In a clean bowl, whisk the egg whites with the cream of tartar until stiff. Gradually add 120g of the sugar, a spoonful at a time, whisking well between each addition until you have a thick, glossy meringue. In a small bowl, mix together the remaining 50g caster sugar, ground almonds and cornflour. Gradually and carefully fold this into the meringue, until evenly combined. Put the mixture into a piping bag fitted with a lcm star nozzle and pipe 24 fingers, about 9cm long and 3cm wide, onto the prepared baking trays. Bake for 20 minutes, then turn off the oven and leave the meringues inside for a couple ofhours until they are set and cooled. For the decoration, put the chocolate into a heatproofbowl set over a pan of gently simmering water, making sure the bottom of the bowl doesn't touch the water, and leave until melted and smooth. For the filling, whip the cream until it is fairly stiffbut still easy to pipe, and place in a piping bag fitted with a large plain nozzle. Place pairs of meringues side-by-side, fiat-side up, to form a V-shape. Pipe cream between the meringues to sandwich them together. Scatter chopped nuts over the cream filling and drizzle the melted chocolate decoratively over the meringues to finish. FIVE-STAR BAKING 141 INDIVIDUAL LEMON MERINGUE PIES MAKES 4 The French have dominated high-end baking because of the finesse of their patisserie. But I think that's wrong! Here's a recipe for a British classic, made on a smaller scale so you can eat it for tea or as a dessert. Take a little bit of care and it will look and taste great. You will have more lemon curd than you need- keep the rest in the fridge in a sealed jar to use as you like- to fill tartlet cases, top pancakes, spread on wholemeal bread etc. ------------------------~-------·----~~----,~------~ .... ~~~---------------- For the base 150g gingernut biscuits 75g unsalted butter, melted For the filling Finely grated zest of 3lemons Juice of6large lemons 50mlwater 2 tbsp cornflour 175g caster sugar 3large egg yolks 25g unsalted butter For the meringue 3large egg whites 175g caster sugar 1 tsp cornflour Crush the ginger biscuits to fine crumbs in a food processor (or use a rolling pin to smash them in a plastic bag) and mix with the melted butter. Divide between four individual10cm loose-based tart tins, 3cm deep, and press the mixture onto the base and sides to line them. Place in the fridge to set. For the filling, put the lemon zest and juice, water, cornflour, sugar and egg yolks in a small heavy-based saucepan. Heat gently, stirring continuously, until the mixture thickens. Be patient, as this will take 10-15 minutes. Stir in the butter to make a thick, glossy lemon curd. Spoon a layer over the biscuit bases and leave to cool. (Keep the rest of the lemon curd in a sealed jar in the fridge to use as required.) Heat your oven to 190°C/Gas 5. Whisk the egg whites in a large, clean bowl until stiff, then add the sugar a spoonful at a time, whisking well between each addition, until you have a thick, glossy meringue. Fold in the cornflour, using a large metal spoon or spatula. Spoon or pipe the meringue generously over the lemon layer and bake for 15 minutes, until the meringue is lightly browned on top. Serve hot, warm or cold, with pouring cream. FIVE - STAR BAKING 142 PRUNE & ARMAGNAC TART SERVE S 8 This is a great tart and the Armagnac's the killer ingredient- it brings a special quality to the flavour. Here I've made a large tart to cut up and share out for afternoon tea or dessert but you can make individual tarts, or bake it in along tranche tin to slice into fingers if you prefer. For the pastry 200g plain flour, plus extra for dusting 2 tbsp icing sugar lOOg cold unsalted butter, cut into small dice !medium egg 1 tsp lemon juice 2-3 tsp cold water For the prunes 175g dried prunes (ideally Agen) 3 tbsp Armagnac (or other brandy) For the filling lOOg unsalted butter, softened lOOg caster sugar 2 largeeggs 50g plain flour 75g ground almonds lOOgplumjam 20g flaked almonds For the glaze 50g caster sugar For the pastry, mix the flour and icing sugar together in a large bowl and rub in the butter with your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Mix the egg with the lemon juice and 2 tsp water, then stir into the rubbed-in mixture, using a table knife. Add the extra 1 tsp water to bring the dough together if necessary. Gently knead the dough into a smooth ball, wrap in cling film and chill for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, soak the prunes in the Armagnac. Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface to a 30cm circle and use to line a 23cm loose-based tart tin, 3.5cm deep, leaving a little excess overhanging the edge. Prick the base with a fork, then chill in the fridge for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Line the pastry case with baking parchment and fill with baking beans. Bake 'blind' for 12-15 minutes, until the pastry is dry to the touch, then remove the paper and beans and return the pastry case to the oven for 5 minutes, until the base is dry and the pastry is lightly coloured. Use a small knife to trim away the excess from the edge. To make the almond filling, beat the butter and sugar together in a bowl until light and fluffy, then beat in the eggs, one at a time. Stir in the flour and ground almonds. Spread the jam over the base of the pastry case. Spoon the almond filling on top and spread to level. Drain the prunes, reserving the juice. Carefully press the prunes into the almond mixture and scatter the flaked almonds on top. Bake for 25-30 minutes, until the filling is risen and golden. For the glaze, in a small pan, heat the reserved prune soaking liquor with the 50g caster sugar. Bring to the boil and let bubble to reduce until it thickens. Brush the surface of the tart with the syrup. Serve warm or at room temperature, with creme fraiche or cream. FIVE-STAR BAKING 144 i APRICOT &ALMOND CLAFOUTIS SERVES 4 If it is made well, a clafoutis is gorgeous. I'd have it with a cup of tea but it's also good with a glass of Cognac or port. It has to be moist and you need to use flavourful fruit, whether it's blackberries, strawberries, raspberries or, For the apricots lOOg caster sugar lOOrnl amaretto liqueur 4 apricots, stoned and each cut into 6 wedges For the batter 2large eggs, plus an extra 2yolks 3 tbsp caster sugar A pinch offine salt 2 tbsp plain flour 125rnl double cream 75rnlrnilk Finely grated zest ofllemon To finish 15g flaked almonds, lightly toasted Icing sugar, for dusting as here, apricots. For the apricots, put the sugar and liqueur into a saucepan. Bring to the boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Place the apricot wedges in the syrup and remove from the heat. Leave to cool. To make the batter, in a bowl or large jug, whisk together the whole eggs, extra yolks, sugar, salt and flour. Add the cream, milk and lemon zest and whisk again until evenly combined. Leave to stand for about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 160°C/Gas 3. Drain the apricots and place them in a shallow ovenproof dish, about 25 x 17cm (saving the syrup for poaching or eating with other fruit). Pour the batter over the apricots and bake for 20-25 minutes, until risen, golden and just set. Scatter over the flaked almonds, dust with icing sugar and serve straight away. FIVE-STAR BAKING 147 ' A LEMON BRIOCHE A TETE MAKES 1 LARGE BRIOCHE A brioche is one of those classic French bakes you have to learn when you're working in a smart hotel. This brioche is shaped so it has a tete, or head. One of the difficulties is to keep this bobble balanced. The trick is not to make the top part too heavy or it will crush the lower one. There's also a special technique in this recipe for joining the two balls together in a way that keeps the tete right on top. You will need to allow plenty of time for the long, slow rise. 350g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting 7g instant dried yeast 5gfine salt 35g caster sugar About lOOml warm whole milk 3 medium eggs Finely grated zest of1lemon 170g unsalted butter (ideally a good-quality Normandy butter), cut into small pieces, softened, plus extra for greasing Egg wash (1 egg, lightly beaten with a little milk), to glaze For the filling and glaze 2 tbsp apricot jam 2 tbsp pearl sugar 200g lemon curd As this is a wet dough with lots ofbutter, I'd highly recommend using a food mixer if possible. Put the flour into a food mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add the yeast to one side of the bowl and the salt and sugar to the other. Now add the milk, eggs and lemon zest and mix on a slow speed for 2 minutes, then on a medium speed for a further 6-8 minutes until you have a soft, glossy, elastic dough. Add the butter pieces and continue to mix for a further 4-5 minutes, scraping down the bowl periodically to ensure that the butter is fully incorporated. The dough will be very soft. Tip the dough into a plastic bowl, cover with cling film and chill for at least 7 hours, or overnight, until it has firmed up and you are able to shape it. Grease a 22cm brioche tin with butter. Take the brioche dough from the fridge. Tip it onto a lightly floured surface and fold it in on itself a few times to knock out the air. Tear off a piece of the dough (about 125g in weight) and shape it into a smooth ball by placing it in a cage formed by your cupped hand on the work surface and moving your hand around in a circular motion, rotating the ball rapidly. Take the larger piece of dough and form it into a smooth, tight ball by cupping it with the sides of your hands and turning it around to create a smooth ball. Press gently to flatten slightly. Continued overleaf FIVE-STAR BAKING 148 I J Dust your middle finger and forefinger with flour and push them through the centre of the larger ball of dough to make a hole (or use the end of a wooden spoon). Now stretch the hole so the ball looks like a tall ring doughnut. Shape the smaller ball into a cylinder and taper one end. Using a knife, slice the bottom half of the tapered end vertically in two, keeping the top half intact. Pull the two ends apart then insert these tapered ends through the hole in the large ball and tuck them outwards underneath the large ball. Form the top of the cylinder into a ball. (This technique keeps the small ball of dough in place when it's baked, otherwise it can tip to the side and won't stay in the middle.) Push the handle of a wooden spoon down through both balls right to the base. This will help the brioche to cook all the way through. Place the brioche in the prepared tin and stand it on a baking tray. Place inside a large, clean plastic bag and leave to prove for 2-3 hours, or until doubled in size. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 190°C/Gas 5. Remove the tray from the plastic bag. Brush the brioche with egg wash and bake for 25- 30 minutes, until risen and golden brown. Note that the sugar and butter will make the brioche colour before it is fully baked. To check it is cooked, carefully tip the brioche out of its tin and tap the bottom: it should sound hollow. If not, return it to the tin and bake for a further 5 minutes. But keep a close eye- if you overcook the brioche, it will become dry. Leave the brioche in its tin for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, gently heat the apricot jam with a little water, then press through a sieve. Brush the top of the brioche with the apricot glaze and sprinkle with the pearl sugar. Remove the brioche from the tin and place on a wire rack. Leave to cool. Spoon the lemon curd into a piping bag fitted with a bismarck nozzle (for filling doughnuts) and inject the brioche from the top with the lemon curd to fill the centre with it. Cut into wedges to serve. FIVE-STAR BAKING 150 SALMON IN BRIOCHE SERVES 4 This is one of the dishes I created at the Dorchester for our special guests. The combination oftastes and textures is amazing: the crispness of the crust on the outside, the softness of the brioche beneath and the gorgeous salmon with a hint of dill in the middle. Allow plenty of time for the lengthy, slow rise. For the dough 375gstrongwhite bread flour 7ginstantdriedyeast 7gfinesalt 3 tbsp caster sugar 5tbspmilk 3 medium eggs 185g unsalted butter (ideally a good -quality Normandy butter), cut into small pieces, softened 1 medium egg, beaten, to glaze For the filling 4 sprigs of dill 4 salmon fillets (about 175g each), skinned and pin-boned Finely grated zest of llemon Salt Put the flour into a food mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and add the yeast to one side and the salt and sugar to the other. Now add the milk and eggs and mix on a medium speed for about 8 minutes until smooth. (If you don't have a freestanding mixer, use a hand-held mixer fitted with dough hooks- the dough is too loose to knead easily by hand.) With the motor running, gradually add the butter pieces, scraping down the bowl periodically. Once all the butter is incorporated and the dough is smooth and sticky, increase the speed and knead for a further 6 minutes. Tip the dough into a large bowl (it will almost double in size), cover with cling film and place in the fridge overnight, or for at least 7 hours. Heat your oven to 200°C/ Gas 6 and line a baking tray with baking parchment. Tip the brioche dough out onto a lightly floured surface and roll out to a 36cm square, about 5mm thick. Cut into 4 even squares. Place a sprig of dill in the centre of each square and sit a portion of salmon on top. Season the salmon lightly with salt and sprinkle with a little lemon zest. Brush the edges of the pastry with beaten egg. Enclose the salmon in the pastry by bringing the two sides along the length of each fillet together and sealing, then folding the two ends up and over. Trim away any excess pastry so it isn't thick where the seams join. (If the pastry is too thick, the fish won't cook properly.) Carefully turn the parcels over and very lightly score the pastry to mark a criss-cross pattern. Brush the surface with more beaten egg and bake the parcels in the oven for 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown. Serve hot or warm. FIVE·STAR BAKING 153 PEA, PANCETTA & PARMESAN TART SERVES 6 This is a lovely, light, refreshing summer tart that is perfect for a more substantial but refined savoury tea. Little chunks of salty pancetta sit alongside sweet peas within a Parmesan and lemon flavoured custard. For the pastry 225gplain flour, plus extra for dusting A pinch of fine salt 60g cold unsalted butter, cut into small dice 60g cold lard, cut into small dice 3-5 tbsp ice-cold water For the filling 195g pancetta, cut into 5-6mmdice Y. red onion, finely diced 5 medium eggs, plus an extra 3 egg yolks 200ml double cream 75g Parmesan, finely grated A pinch of white pepper A pinch of fine salt lOOg ricotta lOOg frozen peas Finely grated zest ofllemon To make the pastry, mix the flour and salt together in a bowl, add the butter and lard and rub in lightly with your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Gradually add the water and mix until the dough begins to come together. Gently knead into a smooth ball, wrap in cling film and chill for at least 30 minutes. Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface to a 3mm thickness and use to line a 25cm loose-based round tart tin, 3.5cm deep, leaving a little excess overhanging the edge. Prick the base all over with a fork, then chill for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Line the pastry case with baking parchment and fill with baking beans. Bake 'blind' for 12-15 minutes, until the pastry is dry to the touch, then remove the paper and beans and return the pastry case to the oven for about 5 minutes, until the base is dry and the pastry is lightly coloured. Use a small, sharp knife to trim away the excess pastry from the edge. Lower the oven setting to 180°C/ Gas 4. To make the filling, cook the pancetta in a dry frying pan over a medium heat until golden and the edges begin to crisp, then remove. Lower the heat under the pan slightly, add the red onion and cook gently in the pancetta fat until softened. In a bowl, beat the eggs, extra yolks and cream together until evenly combined. Add the grated Parmesan, pepper and a small pinch of salt (the pancetta and Parmesan are salty). Scatter the diced pancetta and onion in the pastry case. Dollop the ricotta in heaped teaspoonfuls over the top and scatter over the peas and lemon zest. Carefully pour in the creamy egg mixture. Bake for 35-45 minutes, until the filling is just set and golden. Leave in the tin for 5 minutes, then carefully unmould the tart. Serve warm or cold. FIVE-STAR BAKING 154 r------------------------------ HAM&CHEESE C OISSANTS MAKES 12 For a sensational brunch dish that everyone will remember, it really is worth making your own croissants. The recipe looks long but once you understand the process, it's just a matter of repeating stages that don't take much time. A croissant is all about the layers. Make sure you chill the dough well and roll it out to exactly the same level each time so you don't get more butter in some parts and end up with bread rather than a properly flaky croissant. You'll need to allow around 20 hours in total for chilling the dough. 350g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting 150g plain flour lOg instant dried yeast lOg fine salt 80g caster sugar 280mlwater 300g unsalted butter (ideally a good-quality Normandy butter), softened 120g ham, thinly sliced 200gmature Cheddar, grated 1 egg, beaten, to glaze Put both flours into a food mixer fitted with the dough hook. Add the yeast to one side and the salt and sugar to the other an,d begin mixing on a slow speed. Add the water and mix for a couple of minutes to bring the dough together. Increase the speed and mix for a further 6 minutes. The dough should be fairly stiff. (You can make this dough by hand but I'd recommend using a mixer if possible.) Lift the dough onto a lightly floured surface and form into a ball. Put into a greased bowl, cover with cling film and leave to rest in the fridge for atleast 8 hours, or overnight. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to a rectangle, 60 x 20cm, to end up with a short side facing you. The dough can be quite hard to stretch because it wants to pull back into shape; one tip is to press the sides down onto the work surface to help hold the dough as you roll. Spread the butter out to cover the bottom two-thirds of the dough; make sure it is in an even layer and comes almost to the edges. Fold the exposed dough down to cover half of the butter. Fold the bottom half of the buttered dough up and over, then seal the dough by gently squeezing the edges together. Wrap in cling film and refrigerate for at least an hour, until the butter has hardened. Unwrap the chilled dough, place it on a lightly floured surface and roll again into a rectangle, 45 x 20cm, with a short side facing you. Fold the bottom third of the dough up and the top third down on top. This is called 'a single turn'. Wrap the dough in cling film and place in the FIVE-STAR BAKING 156 fridge for an hour. Repeat this stage three more times, chilling the dough in between turns. Write the number of turns on the cling film with a mar kerpen, as a reminder. After the final tum, wrap the dough in cling film and chill for at least 8 hours, or overnight, to rest and rise slightly. When you are ready to shape the croissants, line two or three baking trays with baking parchment. Place the chilled dough on a lightly floured surface and roll into a rectangle, 42 x 30cm, with a short side facing you. Trim the edges to neaten. Cut the rectangle in two lengthways, then cut triangles along the length of each strip (a pizza wheelis a good tool for this job). The base of each triangle should be about 12cm wide and it should be about15cm high. You will get 6 triangles from each strip (you'll need to trim off a small triangular piece from each end). Cut the ham into pieces that are roughly the same size as the dough triangles. Place a piece of ham on each triangle and sprinkle over some grated cheese. Hold the wide base of the triangle and gently tug the pointed opposite end to cause slight tension in the dough. Starting at the thick end, roll up into a croissant shape. Place the croissants on the prepared trays, leaving space in between for them to expand. Place each tray in a large, clean plastic bag and leave to prove at room temperature for 2 hours, or until the croissants have doubled in size. (If you want to make these in advance, wrap each croissant in cling film before it proves, and freeze. Thaw and prove in the morning for a mid-morning brunch.) Heat your oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Take the trays of croissants out of the bags. Just before baking, brush the croissants with egg wash. Bake for 15 minutes, then lower the oven setting to 180°C/Gas 4 and bake for a further 5 minutes, until risen and golden. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. The croissants are best eaten warm.

The bakes of other countries expand your repertoire. In recent years, the range of ingredients available in this country has exploded, making exotic recipes much more accessible. Most of what you need can be found in supermarkets and delis, or else is easily available online. My travels in baking really began in my late twenties, when I was approached about working as a head baker for a hotel in Cyprus. The guests at the time were mainly from Europe and the hotel needed someone to show the Cypriot guys how European baking worked. Most bakers who went out there stayed six months. I fell in love with the place and stayed for six years. Going to Cyprus was a massive change from life in the north ofEngland. It was very hot in the bakery so we just wore shorts. I got on with the lifestyle and the people, and I made a lot of new friends. Most importantly, I met my wife Alex out there- she was working in the hotel- and we got married in the oldest Christian church on the island. The hotel where I worked is called the Annabelle and it's like something out of a dream: swimming pools, the view of the sea, the heat. Even in winter, it's 25°C when the sun's out. I soon started to pick up the Cypriot way ofbaking. They still make bread at home in the beehive ovens you see all over the island; every family has one in the garden. They're like the outdoor ovens you find in Italy, with an arched opening and a domed interior. They fire the oven up with loads of wood and once the brick starts turning white, you push the wood and ash to one side, mop it out, get a big bunch of oregano tied to a stick and brush the inside of the oven, so the herbs infuse the oven and all your breads. Cypriot families get together on a Sunday- the teenagers, the grandparents, everyone. They might work in the city but BAKES OF THE WORLD 162 I t • I • I • at the weekend they go back to their village to see their yay as - grandmothers- and their mothers. It's all about food, and bread baked in the oven is the centre of that. Like olives, halloumi and feta, it's a celebration of their area. Cyprus has got a Greek aspect, obviously, but it also has a great influence from the Middle East. When I lived in Cyprus, it wasn't part of the EU and I had to leave the country every six months to go and get a stamp on my visa, so I did a lot of travelling in the Middle East, finding out about different ways ofbaking. First I travelled to Jordan to check out their flatbreads. I remember going to the walled city of Petra and coming across a Bedouin woman squatting down on the ground next to a fire, making breads on a small metal dome. As she demonstrated how to make bread in this very basic way I realised that, essentially, nothing in this method had changed for thousands of years. Then I went to Egypt, and there I was fascinated by the tarts and puddings made with set milk or cream. They've often got mastika, or mastic, in there. This is a dried tree resin with the aniseed flavour that runs through many of the bakes in the Middle East, and also Cyprus, and it is one of the more unusual ingredients that I've included in this chapter. The ovens were similar to the ones in Cyprus, except a bit more square and longer, in order to get more into them. Being abroad is about digging around to discover why people eat what they do. In the Middle East, how do you bake when the temperatures are so extreme? You have to adapt your recipes to make them work. What flours do they have? The soils of the Middle East mean the flour is less strong- with less protein to make it rise- and so they make flatbreads . Because many people in the Middle East used to be nomadic, they didn't stay in one place for long enough to build an oven, and kept the bread-making pretty simple. When they did build ovens, they were more like furnaces than our Western ovens. BAKES OF THE WORLD 163 It's all about getting very high temperatures when it comes to flatbreads -the thinner the bread, the faster you want to cook it to stop it drying out. When I travel, I try flavours, I try techniques. I think about the bakes people ate historically and then see how that leads up to what they eat today. There are the differences between countries, and then there are the connections. Just look at the variations on the same ingredients: you think of fruit cake and hot cross buns in Britain but you also find fruited buns and loaves in Italy, France, Norway, Sweden. The methods have changed slightly but the basic recipe is instantly recognisable. Some of these connections go way back. Archaeologists have found sourdough spores in the large ceramic pots they used for bread-making in Ancient Egypt; this style ofbaking, so popular again these days, has long roots. Back in this country, London is one of the world's most important centres offood, thanks to the city's diversity and the huge number of chefs. It's a melting pot offood cultures and top-quality cooking- from Mexican to Indian to Middle Eastern. You can take all these flavour combinations into baking, both savoury and sweet. You can also learn different techniques, though they're not always easy. I once had a go at cooking naan bread in a tandoor in an Indian restaurant and nearly scalded my eyebrows off it was so hot! When I went to work in the Mediterranean, I fell in love with baking all over again. I still travel and bake today. You always discover another approach to food in other countries and different slants on the familiar- flavours, methods, proving, baking. It keeps you learning. BAKES OF THE WORLD 165 FIG&WALNUT BREAD STICKS MAKES 16 Simple to make, these are delicious eaten on their own. They also make a great accompaniment to blue cheese, gooey ripe Brie or an oozy baked Camembert. Make sure that you chop the figs and walnuts quite finely; if they are too chunky, it makes rolling the sticks more difficult. 250gstrongwhite bread flour, plus extra for dusting 5g instant dried yeast Y, tsp fine salt 1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for oiling About 175ml cold water 75g dried figs, cut into small pieces 50g walnuts, finely chopped Tip the flour into a large bowl. Add the yeast to one side and the salt to the other. Add the olive oil and three-quarters of the water and mix together using the fingers of one hand. Add as much of the remaining water as you need to incorporate all the flour and form akneadable dough (it doesn't need to be as soft as a typical bread dough). Tip the dough onto a lightly oiled surface and knead for 5-10 minutes, until smooth and elastic. Place the dough in an oiled bowl, cover with cling film and leave to stand for 1 hour. (The dough should rise but it doesn't need to double in size.) Heat your oven to 220°C/Gas 7 and line two baking trays with baking parchment. Tip the dough onto a lightly floured surface and fold it in on itself repeatedly until all the air is knocked out. Shape into a rectangle then scatter over the chopped figs and walnuts. Fold the dough over itself a few times to incorporate the fruit and nuts. The figs can make the dough sticky so flour your hands and work surface if necessary. Divide the dough into 16 equal pieces and roll each one into a thin stick, about 25-30cm in length. Lay the dough sticks on the prepared trays and bake for 12-15 minutes, until crisp and golden brown. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. BAKES OF THE WORLD 166 J I ' --\" CYPRIOT VILLAGE BREAD MAKES 1 LOAF This loaf, called 'kalouri', is the typical round bread of Cyprus. Mastika is the aromatic dried resin of the mastic tree and has a slightly aniseed flavour, and mahleb is made from the kernels of a type of cherry and has a sweet-sour almondyflavour. The recipe works without these ingredients but, for an authentic bread, you can source them online, or from a good continental deli or Middle Eastern shop. ~ tsp mastika resin (mastic) ~ tsp mechlebe seeds (mahleb) A pinch of sugar 450g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting 7g instant dried yeast 5gfinesalt 3 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for oiling About 300rnl cold water 2 tbsp sesame seeds 1 tbsp black sesame seeds (ornigellaseeds) - .. . .. Using a pestle and mortar, grind the mastika and mechlebe seeds with a pinch of sugar to a powder. Put the flour into a large bowl. Add the yeast to one side and the salt to the other. Add the ground spices and olive oil. Pour three-quarters of the water into the bowl and turn the mixture around with the fingers of one hand, mixing the water into the flour. Continue to add the remaining water, a little at a time, until all the flour is incorporated and you have a rough dough. The dough needs to be soft but not soggy. (You may not need all the water or you may need a little more; it depends on the flour.) Coat the work surface with a little olive oil then carefully tip the dough onto it and knead for 5-10 minutes until soft and smooth. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a clean tea towel and leave to rise until doubled in size. This will take at least an hour and can take 3 hours or longer, depending on the room temperature. Meanwhile, put all the sesame seeds into a bowl, pour on enough hot water to cover and leave to soak and swell while the dough is rising. Line a large baking tray with baking parchment. Tip the risen dough onto a lightly floured surface and fold it inwards repeatedly until all the air is knocked out. Now shape the dough into a ball. To do this, first flatten the dough into a rough rectangle then roll it up into a thick oblong. Turn the dough so that the longer edge is running away from you and flatten it slightly. Now fold the two ends in towards the centre and press them down, so you end up with a chunky, squarish shape. BAKES OF THE WORLD 168 , I ' Turn the dough over, so the join is underneath. With your palms turned upwards, put your hands on each side, slightly under the dough. Turn the ball around, tucking the dough neatly under itself as it turns. You are gently forcing the sides of the dough down and underneath, to create a smooth, taut top and a rough underside. Try to avoid using too much extra flour during shaping if you can. Coat the top and sides of the loaf with the damp sesame seeds, gently pressing them on with your hands. Put the loaf on the prepared tray, then place in a large, clean plastic bag and leave to prove for an hour, or until doubled in size. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 220°C/ Gas 7. Remove the proved loaf from the bag. Just before baking, score the bread about lcm deep around its circumference about halfway down. Also make a couple of2cm deep slashes on top of the loaf. Bake for 30-35 minutes until golden brown and cooked through. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. Photograph overleaf I / I ' • '\\ \" ·' • ,•, ~ , . • • i ... , \\ ... ' ...

Tip onto a lightly floured surface and fold inwards repeatedly until all the air is knocked out. Push down on the dough with your knuckles to shape it into a rectangle, about 25 x 20cm. Crumble the cheese over the surface and scatter over the chives. Fold the dough in on itself a few times, until the cheese and chives are evenly distributed. Flatten the dough into a rectangle again, with a long side facing you. Fold the long side furthest from you into the middle of the rectangle. Then fold the long side closest to you into the middle, on top of the other fold. Turn the loaf over, so you have a smooth top with a seam running along the base. Tuck the ends of the loaf under to create a rough oval shape. Roll the dough firmly but gently so the ends are tapered and you have a fat torpedo shape. Place on the prepared tray with the join underneath. Put the tray inside a large, clean plastic bag and leave the loaf to prove until it has risen and doubled in size. This will take at least an hour and may take up to 3 hours, depending on the room temperature. Heat your oven to 220°C/ Gas 7. Take the tray from the bag. Using a sharp knife, make 3 diagonal slashes, about 2cm deep, in the top of the loaf. Bake for 30-35 minutes, until golden brown. Cool on a wire rack. BAKES OF THE WORLD 172 PITT AS MAKES 4 LARGE OR 6 MEDIUM PITTAS The key to a good pitta is to get your oven as hot as possible but at the same time not to over-bake the breads- you don't want them crispy. They're ready when a fleck of colour appears on the top. If your oven is glass-fronted, keep an eye on them without opening the door. 300g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting 7ginstantdriedyeast 5gfinesalt 1 tbsp dried oregano About 200m! cold water 1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for oiling Tip the flour into a large bowl.

Mix the ingredients together using the fingers of one hand, making sure you gather in all the flour from the side of the bowl. Add the remaining water a little at a time until all the flour is incorporated and you have a smooth, soft dough. (You may not need all the water or you may need a little more; it depends on the flour.) Coat the work surface with a little olive oil then tip the dough onto it. Knead for 5-10 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. Put the dough into a lightly oiled bowl. Cover and leave to rise until the dough has doubled in size. This will take at least an hour and can take 2-3 hours or longer, depending on the room temperature. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 250°C/ Gas 10 (or as high as it will go) and put a baking stone or a large heavy-duty baking tray on the top shelf to heat up. Tip the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knock back by folding the dough in on itself repeatedly until all the air is knocked out. Divide the dough into 4 or 6 equal pieces and shape each one into a ball. Roll out each ball to an oval, 1cm thick. Carefully take the hot trays from the oven and dust with flour. Lay the pittas on the trays and bake for 5- 10 minutes until the breads begin to puff up and just start to colour. Wrap in a clean cloth to help keep them soft. Best eaten warm. BAKES OF THE WORLD 175 NO-KNEAD BREAD MAKES 1 LOAF Travelling the world and meeting like-minded enthusiastic bakers is one of the most enjoyable parts of my work. This recipe originates from celebrated New York City baker Jim Lahey, who came up with the idea of an amazing bread that requires no kneading. He baked it in a Dutch oven, giving the bread its characteristic thick crust. I bake mine in a tin instead. It has a great flavour, good structure with large air pockets and an artisan look. It's a loaf to be proud of- and one that anyone can make. You just need to allow plenty of time for the long, slow rise. 400gstrongwhite bread flour, plus extra for dusting Sgfine salt 2g instant dried yeast (Yz tsp) About 300rnl cold water Fine semolina, wheat bran or extra flour, for dusting the surface Tip the flour into a large bowl. Put the yeast to one side and the salt to the other. Add the water and use a wooden spoon or your hand to mix everything together until you have a wet, sticky dough; this will only take around 30 seconds. The dough should be very sticky to the touch; if it isn't, add another 1-2 tbsp water. Cover the bowl with cling film and leave at room temperature (but out of direct sunlight), until the dough has more than doubled in size and the surface is dotted with bubbles. This will take at least 8 hours. Once the dough is risen, generously dust your work surface with flour. Use aplastic dough scraper or a spatula to scrape the dough out of the bowl in one piece onto the floured surface. As you pull the dough away from the edge of the bowl, it will cling in long, thin strands and will be quite loose and sticky. Don't be tempted to add more flour. Dust your hands with flour and lift the edges of the dough in towards the centre. Tuck the edges in to form a round shape. Place the dough, smooth side uppermost, in a 20cm springform tin and dust the surface with flour, semolina or wheat bran. Cover and leave to rise for 8 hours. Heat your oven to 220°C/ Gas 7. Bake the loaf for about 20 minutes, then lower the oven setting to 200°C/Gas 6 and bake for a further 40 minutes, until the crust is a deep chestnut colour. Remove the loaf from the tin and place on a wire rack to cool. Don't be tempted to cut or tear the bread until it has cooled completely; this will take at least an hour. BAKES OF THE WORLD 177 PESHWARI NAAN BREAD MAKES 6 This is a recipe for a classic Peshwari naan, suitable for the home cook. Once you've mastered the recipe, you can play around with flavours for your naan, adding black cumin, caraway or poppy seeds, or brushing them at the end with different flavoured oils, such as a garlic-infused oil or walnut oil. --------------------~--~~--------------~-------~~------------------ 450g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting Y. tsp baking powder 5g instant dried yeast 1 tsp fine salt 2 tsp caster sugar About 150ml warm whole milk About 150ml natural yoghurt 2 tbsp sunflower or vegetable oil, plus extra for oiling 25g desiccated coconut 25gsultanas 25g flaked almonds 25gunsalted butter Mix the flour and baking powder together in a bowl and add the yeast to one side and the salt and sugar to the other. Heat the milk in a pan over a low heat until warm, then remove from the heat and mix with the yoghurt. Pour three-quarters of this liquid into the flour and mix together using the fingers of one hand. Add as much of the remaining liquid as you need to gather in all the flour and form a rough dough that comes away from the side of the bowl. Coat the work surface with a little oil then tip the dough out onto it. Knead for 5-10 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. Place in a lightly oiled bowl, cover and leave to rise for 1 hour. Tip the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knock back by folding it in on itself repeatedly until all the air is knocked out. Roll out into a rough rectangle and scatter the coconut, sultanas and flaked almonds over the surface. Fold the dough over repeatedly to incorporate the filling then roll into a ball. Divide the dough into 6 pieces and shape each one into a ball. Flatten each ball then roll into a teardrop shape, about 3-5mm thick. Heat a large frying pan over a medium-high heat and add 1 tsp oil and 1 tsp butter. Once the butter has melted, lay one piece of dough in the pan. Cook for 3-4 minutes, or until the underside is turning golden and speckled with brown patches. Turn over and cook the other side for 2 minutes, or until it is speckled with brown and cooked through. Remove the naan from the pan and wrap it in a clean tea towel (this helps to keep it soft); keep warm. Cook the remaining naan in the same way, adding a little more oil and butter to the pan as required. Enjoy with your favourite curry. BAKES OF THE WORLD 178 DOS AS MAKES 6 You need to plan ahead when making these South Indian pancakes as the rice and lentils need soaking. They are then ground and the batter is left to ferment. It's not difficult but practice and patience are required. You need the right consistency for the batter, to cook it at the right temperature and to get the dosas as thin as possible. Buy skinned, split lentils for this recipe. My optional filling is a tasty dry potato curry to spread on the dosas. ------------------------~------~---.----------·------·~---------------- For the dosas 250g basmati rice 75g urid dal (skinned and split black lentils) Y. tsp fenugreek seeds 500mlwater Y. tsp fine salt Sunflower oil, for cooking For the filling Potato mas ala (see opposite) and/or a small jar of your favourite chutney Wash the rice and lentils in a sieve then place in a large bowl with the fenugreek seeds. Cover with the water and leave to soak for at least 6 hours, or overnight. Drain the rice and lentils, saving 250ml of the liquid. Put the soaked rice and lentils into a blender and pour in 175ml of the liquid. Blitz thoroughly, scraping down the sides occasionally. Add the remaining liquid and blend to a completely smooth batter. Pour the batter into a bowl, cover with a clean tea towel and leave to stand and ferment overnight. The batter should be slightly risen and have small bubbles on the surface. The consistency should be slightly thicker than pancake batter, so add a little more water if it is too thick. Stir in the salt. Heat a 20cm frying pan over a medium heat and wipe the surface with an oiled wad of kitchen paper. Using a ladle or large spoon, pour enough batter into the centre of the pan to coat the base as thinly as possible, using the bottom of the ladle or spoon to spread it out. Cook for about 2 minutes until the underside is golden, then use a palette knife to turn the do sa. Cook for a minute on the other side, then remove to a warmed plate. Repeat until all the batter is used, stacking the dosas interleaved with greaseproofpaper; keep them warm in a low oven. Wipe the pan with more oil as necessary to stop the batter sticking. Spread the cooked dosas with a thin layer of potato masala and/or chutney, roll up and eat straight away.

Cook for 1 minute, until the lentils darken in colour and the seeds begin to pop. Add 15 small curry leaves and 1 chopped onion, lower the heat and cook for 7- 8 minutes or until the onion begins to soften. Add lOOml water, cover and cook for 10 minutes or until the onion is very soft and the liquid has reduced down. Add 2 sliced green chillies ( deseeded for less heat, if preferred), a finely grated 2cm piece of ginger, Y2 tsp ground turmeric and Y2 tsp fine salt. Stir and cook for a few minutes until the liquid has evaporated. Add the potato chunks and stir to coat them in the spices - don't worry if they break down; this is a dry curry that is intended to be spreadable. Stir through 2 tbsp chopped coriander or flat-leafparsley, then taste and adjust the seasoning before serving.

Add the yeast to one side and the salt to the other. Make a well in the middle and pour in the olive oil and three-quarters of the water. Turn the mixture around with your fingers, adding more of the water, until all the flour is incorporated and you have a rough dough. The dough needs to be soft but not soggy. (You may not need all the water or you may need a little more; it depends on the flour.) Coat your work surface with a little olive oil, then tip the dough onto it and knead for 5-10 minutes until the dough is smooth and silky. Place the dough in a clean bowl, cover and leave to rise until doubled in size. This will take at least an hour and can take 2-3 hours or even longer, depending on the room temperature. The longer it takes, the more flavour the dough will develop; ideally, leave it somewhere cool, but not the fridge. To make the filling, heat the olive oil in a pan, add the onion and fry gently until soft but not coloured. Add the garlic, chilli flakes and fennel seeds and cook, stirring occasionally, for 2-3 minutes. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside. Remove the sausages from their skins and add them to the pan with the salt. Cook over a medium-high heat, using a wooden spoon to break the sausages down into small pieces. Cook until the pieces of sausage are brown and a little crisp on the outside. Remove from the heat, return the onion mixture to the pan and stir to distribute evenly. Once cooled, stir through the chopped parsley. Continued overleaf BAKES OF THE WORLD 184 Heat your oven to 200°C/ Gas 6 and line a baking tray with baking parchment. When the dough is ready, tip it onto a floured surface. Roll it out into a rough rectangle, about 40 x 30cm. Turn the dough goo if necessary, so you have a long side facing you. Take a third of the meat and place it in aline along the bottom, leaving a 3cm clear margin at the edge. Dot a third of the ricotta over the meat then sprinkle with a third of the Parmesan. Roll the dough up from the bottom, enclosing the filling in the dough (rather like a Swiss roll). As soon as the filling is encased, stop rolling and add another line of meat, ricotta and Parmesan. Roll the dough up again to enclose the filling. Continue with a third layer of filling, which will lie towards the top edge of the dough. Now roll up again so you have a large cylinder of filled dough. Trim the ends. Pull the cylinder of dough to straighten and make sure it is even all the way along. Rotate the cylinder of dough goo on the work surface so that it extends away from you then, starting at the top, coil the dough into an upwards spiral. Place the loaf on the baking tray, brush with olive oil and scatter over the fennel seeds and chilli flakes. Bake for 25-30 minutes until crisp and golden.

Add three-quarters of the water and mix with the fingers of one hand. Gradually add more water to form a very soft dough that comes away from the side of the bowl. (You may not need it all or you may need more. I like pizza dough to be as wet as possible.) Turn the dough onto an oiled surface and knead for 5-10 minutes, until smooth and elastic. To check it's kneaded sufficiently, cut off a small piece and stretch part of it as thinly as you can. If it doesn't tear and the light shines through, it's ready. If not, keep going. Shape into a ball, place in a clean bowl, cover and leave to rest for 10-12 hours. Divide the dough in half and form each piece into a ball. Stretch or roll each ball into a thin circle, about 26cm in diameter, and place on a floured baking tray. Heat your oven to 220°C/Gas 7 and put a pizza stone or flat baking tray on the top shelf to heat up for 30 minutes. For the topping, using a swivel vegetable peeler, cut the courgette into ribbons. Toss in a bowl with 1 tbsp olive oil and some salt and pepper. Place one pizza dough base on the hot stone or tray and bake for 3-4 minutes. Take it out and switch the oven to grill setting. Scatter half the grated cheeses and mozzarella over the pizza base. Trickle over Y2 tbsp olive oil then lay half the courgette ribbons on top. Dot with teaspoonfuls ofricotta, using half of it. Slide the pizza into the oven, placing it 10cm or so from the grill. Cook for 4-5 minutes, until the topping is bubbling; watch closely to ensure the crust doesn't burn. Repeat the process to cook the other pizza. Just before serving, sprinkle with the grated lemon zest and thyme sprigs. BAKES OF THE WORLD 190 JULE V0RTBR0D MAKES 1 LOAF This yeasted fruit bread comes from Scandinavia, where it's traditionally made with the local non-alcoholic fruit beer.

Stir in the sugar and yeast, then the ground spices and salt, making sure they are evenly distributed. Add the beer and begin to mix, then gradually incorporate the milk and mix to form a rough dough. Tip the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it for 5-10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Flatten into a rough rectangle, scatter a quarter of the raisins over the surface, then fold the dough over itself a couple of times to disperse the fruit. Repeat this three times until all the raisins are incorporated and evenly distributed through the dough. Place the dough in a bowl, cover and leave to rise until doubled in size. This will take at least 3 hours and may take longer; the quantity of fruit makes this loaf take longer to rise. Line a baking tray with baking parchment. Tip the risen dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knock out the air by folding it in on itself repeatedly. Flatten the dough into a rectangle and fold the long sides into the middle. Roll up so the top is smooth and you have a join running along the middle of the underside. The loaf should be an oval shape. Place on the lined baking tray and put the tray inside a large, clean plastic bag. Leave to prove for about 2 hours - it is ready when the dough springs back when lightly pressed. Heat your oven to 180°C/ Gas 4. Remove the tray from the bag and brush the loaf with milk to glaze. Bake for 40-50 minutes, until risen and the crust is dark brown. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.

Meanwhile, to make the orange syrup, put all the ingredients into a saucepan and slowly bring to the boil, then simmer for 10-15 minutes until the syrup reduces and thickens slightly but is still pourable (it will thicken further as it cools). Leave to cool. Pour enough oil into a deep, heavy saucepan to fill it by no more than a third (or use a deep-fryer and more oil). Heat the oil to 180°C, or until a cube ofbread dropped into the hot oil turns brown in about 1 minute. You will need to cook the doughnuts in batches, ideally 5 or 6 at a time, to avoid overcrowding the pan. Carefully drop large teaspoonfuls of the batter into the hot oil. They will puff up and begin to turn golden. Cook for about 2-3 minutes on each side, turning them with tongs to ensure they cook evenly. Try to maintain the oil at a constant temperature. Remove the doughnuts from the oil using a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. Once all the doughnuts are cooked, pour half the orange syrup into a large bowl, add the hot doughnuts and walnuts and toss to coat in the syrup, adding more syrup if needed. Sprinkle with the ground cinnamon and serve hot, with Greek yoghurt and the rest of the orange syrup in a small jug on the side.

Lay a sheet offilo on your work surface and brush with butter. Lay another sheet of pastry on top and brush with butter. Spread out one-fifth of the walnut filling (about 3Y2 tbsp) along the long edge nearest you. Roll up tightly, as if you were rolling a Swiss roll. Trim the ends that contain little filling. Form the roll into a spiral and place it in the middle of the prepared tin. Repeat the process to make another 4 rolls, coiling each one and arranging them in the tin around the central spiral to form a ring. You don't want the spirals to be too tight- the edges of each roll need to get the chance to cook. Brush the top and outside edges of the spirals with melted butter, then bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the baklava is golden brown. Meanwhile, make the syrup: place all the ingredients in a pan and bring to the boil. Lower the heat and simmer for about 10 minutes, or until reduced and thickened to a pourable syrup. Slice the baklava into Scm pieces, leaving them in the tin, then pour on the syrup while the pastry is still hot. Let the baklava sit and soak up the syrup for an hour before serving. Store any that won't be eaten straight away in a non-metallic container. BAKES OF THE WORLD 196 r BLUEBERRY CHEESECAKE MAKES 12 SLICES The perfect cheesecake is slightly under-set and the Americans make the best. I fell for this particular one when filming in Miami at a restaurant specialising in seafood. After eating fish all day, it tasted especially good. For the base 150gunsalted butter, softened 75g caster sugar 150g plain flour A pinch of fine salt 50g semolina (or ground rice) 100gblueberryjam For the filling 400g full-fat cream cheese 1 tbsp custard powder 50g caster sugar 2 medium eggs 1 tsp vanilla extract 125ml double cream 125gblueberries Heat your oven to 150°C/Gas 2. Grease a 27 x 18cm baking tin, about 4cm deep, and line with baking parchment. For the base, beat the butter and sugar together in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Add the flour, salt and semolina (or ground rice) and bring everything together to form a dough; try not to overwork it. Press the mixture onto the base of the baking tin. Lay a sheet ofbaking parchment on top, press evenly to level the base, then remove. Prick the base all over with a fork. Bake for 35-40 minutes until cooked but still pale. Leave to cool in the tin. Turn the oven up to 175°C/Gas 3 Y2. To make the filling, in a large bowl, slowly beat 100g cream cheese with the custard powder and 1 tbsp of the sugar, using a hand-held electric whisk, until smooth. Add another 100g cream cheese with 1 tbsp sugar and whisk again on a low speed, scraping down the sides of the bowl every so often as you go. Repeat twice more, until all the cream cheese and sugar are incorporated. Don't be tempted to rush this stage; this careful process creates the velvety smooth texture. Whisk in the eggs, one at a time, on a medium speed then incorporate the vanilla and cream. Finally, carefully fold in the blueberries. Spread the jam over the cooled base. Spoon on the filling and spread out in an even layer. Stand the tin in a large roasting tray and pour in enough cold water to come halfway up the sides of the tin. Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the edges of the cheesecake are lightly golden and the centre has a slight wobble. Lift out of the roasting tin. Carefully lift the cheesecake in its parchment from the tin and transfer to a wire rack to cool. Once cold, peel away the parchment and place the cheesecake on a plate. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours to firm up. Cut the cheesecake into slices, using a knife dipped into just-boiled water. Eat just as it is, or serve with extra berries. BAKES OF THE WORLD 199 CHERRY TART SERVES 8 Here's a fabulous tart that I came across on a trip to Paris. There's the shortbread -like pastry, the soft creamy filling, then the fruit: it all comes together and melts in your mouth. ----------------------·----------~-~·~--···--·--~·--~--~~~--~--------------- For the pastry 200gplain flour 2 tbsp icing sugar 100g cold unsalted butter, cut into small dice llarge egg yolk 2-3 tbsp cold water For the custard filling 400rnl whole milk 4large egg yolks lOOg caster sugar 3 tbsp cornflour 1 tsp vanilla extract 1 tbsp kirsch 125rnl whipping cream For the topping 350g cherries, pitted and halved 4 tbsp cherry jam 1 tbsp kirsch To make the pastry, mix the flour and icing sugar together in a large bowl and rub in the butter using your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Mix the egg yolk with 2 tbsp water, then stir into the rubbed-in mixture, using a round-bladed knife. Add the extra water if needed to bring the dough together. Gently knead into a smooth ball, wrap in cling film and chill for at least 30 minutes. To make the custard, slowly heatthe milk in a pan until it just comes to the boil. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, sugar and cornflour. As the milk comes to the boil, pour it onto the egg mixture, whisking as you do so. Pour back into the pan and heat gently, stirring constantly, for about 5 minutes until the custard thickens. Take off the heat and stir in the vanilla and kirsch. Pour into a clean bowl and cover the surface closely with cling film to prevent a skin forming. Leave to cool (then refrigerate if making well in advance). Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface to about a 30cm circle and use to line a 23cm loose-based fluted tart tin, 3.5cm deep, leaving a little excess pastry overhanging the edge. Prick the base all over with a fork, then chill in the fridge for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Line the pastry case with baking parchment and fill with baking beans. Bake 'blind' for 12-15 minutes until the pastry is dry to the touch, then remove the paper and beans and return to the oven for 5 minutes or so, until the base is dry and the pastry is lightly coloured. Let cool, then use a small, sharp knife to trim the excess pastry from the edge. To assemble the tart, whip the cream to soft, firm peaks and fold into the cold custard. Spoon into the cooled pastry case then spread out to level the surface. Starting from the outer edge, arrange the cherry halves in concentric circles on top of the tart to cover it completely. Warm the cherry jam with the kirsch, press through a sieve, then brush this glaze over the cherries. Refrigerate until ready to serve. BAKES OF THE WORLD 200 MARZIPAN &APPLE TART SERVES 4-6 This is my spin on a Normandy apple tart. Making your own marzipan is crucial; shop-bought doesn't have such a high proportion of almonds and will melt. The flavour of the apples balances the flavour of the nuts beautifully. For the marzipan llOg ground almonds 50g icing sugar, sifted, plus extra for dusting 50g caster sugar A few drops of almond extract 'l:i: tsp lemon juice 2 medium egg yolks For thefrangipane 40gunsalted butter, softened 40g caster sugar lmediumegg 20g plain flour 30g ground almonds For the apple layer llarge or 2 medium eating apple(s) 2 tbsp apricot jam ltbspwater To make the marzipan, mix the ground almonds and both sugars together in a large bowl. Add the almond extract, lemon juice and egg yolks and mix to combine. At first, the mixture will feel dry and crumbly but keep squeezing and kneading and it will come together. When it starts to form a ball, lightly dust your work surface with icing sugar and knead the marzipan on it to form a smooth paste. Wrap in cling film and chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes. To make the frangipane, beat the butter and sugar together until the mixture is light and fluffy, then add the egg and combine well. Add the flour and ground almonds and mix to a smooth, thick paste. Heat your oven to 190°C/ Gas 5 and line a baking tray with a sheet of baking parchment. Dust the work surface with icing sugar again and roll out the marzipan to an 18cm circle, about Smm thick (use a plate as a template). Lift it onto the prepared baking tray. Spread the frangipane over the marzipan in a thick layer, leaving a Smm clear margin around the edge. Quarter and core the apple(s) then cut into 3mm slices. Arrange the apple slices over the frangipane in concentric circles. Bake for 12- 15 minutes, until the frangipane is risen and golden brown. Heat the apricot jam with the water and press through a sieve. Brush the apricot glaze over the top of the warm tart. Serve with cream, or just as it is.

Add the egg yolk and mix until just combined. Add the flour, baking powder, salt and ground pecans and fold in, using a large metal spoon, until evenly incorporated. The pastry will be very soft at this stage, so scrape it together to form a ball, then place between two sheets of grease proof paper. Roll out the pastry thinly between the paper to a 20cm circle, 1-2cm thick. Remove the top sheet of paper and invert the pastry onto the base of the greased tin. Remove the other sheet of paper. Push the dough into the fluted edge of the tin and press the base to level the surface. Prick all over with a fork. Cover loosely with baking parchment and place in the fridge to rest for 6-8 hours, or overnight. Heat your oven to 170°C/ Gas 3 'lz . Remove the parchment covering the pastry base then bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes, until golden brown. Leave it to firm up and cool down completely. For the filling, using a hand -held electric whisk, beat the mascarpone, cream cheese, blue cheese and honey together until smooth. Put into a piping bag fitted with a lcm nozzle, or use a paper piping bag and snip lcm off the tip. (Alternatively, the filling can be spread rather than piped onto the base.) To assemble the tart, carefully remove the pastry case from the tin and place on a serving plate. Pipe peaks of the whipped cheese filling in concentric circles over the base (or spread it evenly using a metal spoon). Arrange the fig wedges on top of the filling and finish with the chopped pecans. Drizzle over the honey just before serving. BAKES OF THE WORLD 204 A RETURN TO BRITISH BAKING TELEVISION IS A DIFFERENT WAY ofteaching.Peopleliketo be entertained as they learn- you know that from back at school and the teachers who made you want to listen. I want viewers to get little nuggets that they can take back to the kitchen and use. When I came back to live in Britain in 1999, I started to run my own bakeries and at the same time began to appear on Tv. I'm not quite sure why but being in front of a camera came naturally. The advice is always to be yourself. I'm not an actor so it was straightforward to do just that. It was 2010 when I got a call from Love Productions telling me about a new programme they were making. Would I be interested in auditioning? Someone from the production team came to my house, tipped out a bag ofbakes and said: judge them. Then I met my fellow presenters and it all fell into place. You cannot fake chemistry; it happens from day one. The programme really started to take shape in the first series. In the original Bake Offline up, Mary was everyone's grandma, including mine. She was from the tradition ofhome baking. I was used to dealing in 20kg of flour for making batches ofbread, while Mary thinks in grams. She was the comforting arm around the shoulder while I was more the teacher who said, 'I think you should do this, see me afterwards.' My job was to be a straight, honest and fair judge. You have to give constructive criticism so the contestants learn. Bake Off is ajourney for them, just as baking has been for me in my own life. Mel and Sue were the gel between us all who kept us sane. They lightened the mood and everyone was happier for it. But Bake Off is not about the hosts and the judges, it's about the bakers- they are the stars of the show. It's important for them to manage their time properly in order to succeed- and the same thing is true in a professional bakery. A bakery has to be working at all levels, immediately, because if your ovens are SHOWSTOPPING PIES, PUDS & CAKES 208 .. l I \" on and not being used, you're wasting money. So you plan your time carefully. That's also true at home, when you want to be efficient as you bake, and make the most of your time. The bakers need two other qualities to do well: technique and artistic flair. Most have a bit of one aspect, and a lot of the other. Some might be talented and artistic, but have more style than substance. The skill is to marry the two together. When you get both, it's magical. The ones who do well in the competition tend to develop over time. And sometimes they're lucky, because another baker just happens to have done worse that day. The challenges we set for contestants show off and test their skills, and encourage people at home to bake. The Showstopper is the 'wow factor'. It's most often a highly decorated bake and this is where a baker's creativity shines through. What viewers get from this is ideas - how to create three-tiered cakes, how to make something look good. Some of the recipes in this chapter, such as the Swiss roll and the roulade, are more of a technical challenge that you can learn and then adapt to your own tastes. I've also given recipes for some of my favourite pies, a British tradition that we feature in the programme. Then there are the recipes that take technique to perfect, such as a mirror glaze on a cake. And there are some impressive pudding recipes, including souflles, that aren't that difficult to make once you've learnt a few tricks. People watching an elaborate cake being prepared may think, 'I don't think I could make that.' But there are also ways to make a bake special with the minimum amount of work and fuss. Part of this is flavour. But be careful - stick with flavours that you like and know work well together. There are lots of trendy and strange tastes out there. In reality you'll probably prefer coconut, banana, strawberry to Earl Grey or lavender. If you're dealing with flavours such as lavender, rosemary or rose then be sparing. Don't go crazy because the taste will kill everything. SHOWSTOPPING PIES, PUDS & CAKES 209 When I first started doing television, baking was seen as niche. But Bake Offhas had far more people watching it than any other cookery show. Sales ofbakeware, food mixers and different kinds of flours have soared and I can even see its impact in my day-to-day life. Everybody and anybody asks me about baking: 'My bread's too tight'; 'My cake's dropped in the middle'; 'How do I make a decent souffle?' The questions I get asked are many and varied. Builders shout out to me at the traffic lights- 'I burnt me cakes, mate, what am I doing wrong?' I get grandmas and kids coming up to me in supermarkets about their brownies. Why is this? It's because we're a nation ofbakers and we'd forgotten about that. We went through twenty years ofbuying stuff rather than making it. Now we've come back to making again. Some of the bakes in mainland Europe are complicated, but in this country we have some great basic bakes with good flavours. We've got a plethora of ingredients from all over the world to use. We've got some of the best flours. We've also got great bakers. No wonder people want to bake and learn more than ever before. SHOWSTOPPING PIES, PUDS & CAKES 211 BREAKFAST PIE SER V ES 6 This delicious pie takes its name from a filling that contains many of the ingredients of a classic English breakfast.

Roll out two-thirds of the pastry on a lightly floured surface and use to line a 20cm loose-based tart tin, Scm deep, leaving a little excess overhanging the edge of the tin. Roll out the rest ofthe pastry and cut into 12-14 strips, each 1cm wide and 22cm long. On a board covered with a sheet ofba.king parchment, use the pastry strips to create a lattice, with 6- 7 strips going each way, weaving them under and over each other. Place in the fridge while you make the filling. In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese with 2 eggs until smooth. Add the grated cheese and chopped parsley and season with a little salt and a pinch of pepper. Stir in the cooled onion and bacon mixture, along with the sausage pieces. Spoon the filling into the pastry case and make 3 evenly spaced depressions in the surface. Crack the remaining eggs into them. Dampen the pastry rim with water and invert the lattice from the parchment onto the pie. Press the ends of the strips onto the pastry rim, then trim to neaten. Brush the pastry lattice with beaten egg to glaze. Bake the pie for 35-40 minutes, until golden brown. Leave to stand for 15 minutes before cutting. It can be eaten hot, warm or cold. HAGGIS PASTIES MAKES 5 Haggis is packed with flavour, making it an ideal pie filling. I've paired it with two typical accompaniments- neeps and tatties- and put them all in a pasty.

To make the pastry, mix the flour with the salt in a large bowl. Add the lard and butter and rub in lightly with your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Using a round-bladedknife, stir in just enough water to make a firm dough. Knead gently into a ball, wrap in cling film and place in the fridge to chill for at least 30 minutes. For the filling, thinly slice the onion and cut the swede and potato into small, thin pieces. Place each vegetable in its own bowl. Remove the uncooked haggis from its casing and crumble into another bowl. Heat your oven to 200°C/ Gas 6. Dust your work surface with flour and divide the pastry into 5 equal pieces. Roll out each piece to a round, about 3mm thick, and cut out a 24cm circle, using a plate as a guide. To fill and shape each pasty, scatter a thin layer of swede over half of the circle, leaving a lcm clear margin. Add a similar layer of potato, season lightly with salt and pepper, then top with some onion. Repeat the swede and potato layers, seasoning as you go and checking that the pastry will still go over the top to encase the filling. Top with a layer of crumbled haggis. Add a final layer of onion, season once more and dot with butter. Brush the pastry border with beaten egg, then fold the pastry over the filling, so the edges meet. Press these together firmly and crimp by pinching the pastry edge all round between the thumb and forefinger. Put the filled and sealed pasties on the prepared baking trays. Cut 2 slits in the centre of each pasty and brush the top with beaten egg. Bake the pasties for 20 minutes, then lower the oven setting to 160°C/Gas 3 and bake for a further 30 minutes until golden brown. These pasties are best eaten warm. SHOWSTOPPING PIES, PUDS & CAKES 214 BEEF &ALE PIE SERVES 4 This is comfort food at its best, with the beer giving the sauce both depth of flavour and richness. I'd recommend using bitter or stout.

Add the pieces of meat and toss in the seasoned flour until evenly coated. Heat 2 tbsp oil in a large, flameproof casserole. When it is hot, quickly brown the meat in small batches on all sides, removing the pieces with a slotted spoon to a plate as soon as they are coloured, and adding more oil to the pan as necessary. Once all the meat is browned and set aside, add a little more oil to the pan if needed and cook the onions, celery and carrots over a medium -low heat, stirring occasionally, for about 5 minutes. Return the meat to the pan and stir, then pour in the beer and stock. Add the Worcestershire sauce, sugar, bay leaf, thyme and a little salt and pepper. Bring to the boil, then lower the heat to a simmer and cook gently, covered, for at least 2 hours, until the beef is tender. Tip the filling into a 1.2litre pie dish and leave to cool completely. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 200°C/Gas 6. To make the suet pastry, put the flour and suet into a large bowl, add some salt and pepper and stir to mix. Add 200rnl water and mix to a soft sticky dough with one hand, adding more water to bring the dough together if required. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to a large oval, about Scm bigger than the top of your pie dish all round and 5-7mm thick. Cut a 2cm wide strip of pastry from around the outside. Dampen the rim of the pie dish with water, position the pastry strip on the rim and brush this with a little water. Lay the pastry oval over the top and press down the edges onto the pastry strip to seal. Crimp the edges to seal, then trim off the excess pastry. Bake the pie for 30-40 minutes until the pastry is golden brown. Let the pie stand for 10 minutes before serving.

Either way, I want good pork sausages or spicy Lincolnshire hangers. One of the keys to achieving the best batter is to use good eggs; get the freshest you can for the best results. Bsausages 60g beef dripping, in small pieces For the batter 125g plain flour 1 tsp fine salt 2largeeggs BOmlmilk About 40ml cold water Heat your oven to 220°C/Gas 7. First make the batter. Put the flour and salt into a bowl, make a well in the middle and add the eggs. Using a wooden spoon, beat the mixture to a thick paste, incorporating the flour from the sides of the well. Gradually add the milk and continue to mix until the batter is smooth and lump-free. Leave to restfor at least 30 minutes. Place the sausages and dripping in a 30 x 20cm roasting tray and cook for 15-20 minutes, until browned. Stir the cold water into the batter. It should now be the consistency of pouring cream; add a little more water if necessary. Remove the hot tray of sausages from the oven, turn the sausages over then pour in the batter mix- take care as the fat may spit. Return the roasting tray to the oven and cook for 20- 25 minutes, until the batter is risen and crisp. Don't be tempted to open the oven door before the batter is cooked as this will cause it to sink. Serve with mashed potatoes and gravy.

To make the hot water crust pastry, combine the flours in a large bowl and rub in the butter using your fingertips until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Put the lard, water and salt into a saucepan and place over a medium heat until the mixture just begins to boil, then immediately pour onto the flour and mix with a wooden spoon. Once cool enough to handle, gather the dough, tip onto a lightly floured surface and knead to form a smooth ball. Cut off a quarter of the dough for the lid and set aside (ideally in the still-warm pan used to heat the lard mix as this will help to keep it pliable). Working quickly (while the pastry is still warm), flatten the larger ball of dough with the palm of your hand. Take a 9.5 x llcm wooden pie dolly, dust with flour and sit it in the middle of the dough. Use your hands to raise the pastry up the sides of the dolly. Once you are almost halfway, turn the dolly upside down and work the pastry down the dolly until the pastry covers about three-quarters ofit. Trim the edge to neaten and leave the pastry to set slightly. To make the filling, mix all the ingredients together in a large bowl until well combined and shape into a cylinder, a bit smaller than the pie case on the dolly. Roll out the remaining pastry to a 12cm circle for the pie lid. Continued overleaf SHOWSTOPPING PIES, PUDS & CAKES 220 Use a small knife to ease the pastry case from the dolly then fill the cavity with the meat filling. (If the pastry falls down when it comes off the dolly just mould it up again over the meat.) Brush the edge of the pastry with beaten egg yolk and place the lid over the filling. Press the edges together to seal and trim off the excess pastry. Pinch the edges together to crimp decoratively. Carefully lift the pie onto the prepared baking tray and cut a small hole in the pastry lid to let the steam out. Brush the top and sides of the pie with the beaten egg, taking care to get the brush into the crimped edge. Bake for 50 minutes until the pastry is golden brown. Leave to cool slightly. In the meantime, to make the jelly, dissolve the stock cube in the boiling water in a bowl. Soak the gelatine leaves in a dish of cold water for a few minutes to soften. Lift out the gelatine, squeeze out any excess water, then add to the stock, stirring to dissolve. Insert a funnel into the hole in the top of the pie and gradually add the gelatine mixture to fill the cavity between the meat and the pastry- add it a little at a time and let the liquid seep down before pouring in more. Once the pie is cool enough, place it in the fridge to set the jelly for a few hours, or overnight.

Toast the cumin seeds in a dry frying pan for a couple of minutes until fragrant but not burnt, then grind coarsely, using a pestle and mortar. In a large bowl, mix the minced pork, chopped chorizo, toasted cumin, smoked paprika and chilli flakes together and add some salt. (To check the seasoning, break off a small piece of the mixture and fry in a little oil until cooked then taste it.) Remove the boiled eggs from the water, tap to break the shells, then peel. Take three bowls and tip the flour into one, lightly beat the eggs in another and place the breadcrumbs in the third. Divide the meat mixture into 4 equal portions. Lay a piece of cling film on your work surface, place a portion of the meat mixture on it and press down evenly to flatten. Take a boiled egg and dust with flour then sit on the flattened meat mixture. Bring the sides of the meat up around the egg, using the cling film to help wrap the egg; this also prevents the meat sticking to your hands. Dip the meat-wrapped egg in the beatE!n egg, then coat thoroughly in breadcrumbs. Dip in the egg and crumbs once more, giving it two coats for a crisper outside. Repeat with the other 3 boiled eggs. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. 1 Heat your oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Heat the oil into a deep-fryer or in a large, heavy saucepan, filling it is no more than one-third full. Heat theroil to 170°C, or until a cube ofbread dropped in turns brown in just over a minute. Deep-fry the eggs, two at a time, for 6-8 minutes until the outside is a deep golden brown colour, turning them over halfway through. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. To ensure the meat is cooked through, place the Scotch eggs on a baking tray in the oven for a further 8 minutes. Eat hot or cold . • .. • ·. .. • I ' , PUMPKIN PIE SERVES12 This traditional American pie has now become popular here as an autumnal dessert. I love the crisp base and the rich, spiced taste of the filling. For the pastry 200g plain flour, plus extra for dusting 2 tbsp icing sugar, sifted 1 tsp ground cinnamon 100g cold unsalted butter, cut into small dice 1 medium egg, beaten About 2 tsp very cold water For the filling 450g pumpkin or butternut squash 2cm piece of root ginger, peeled and sliced 2 tbsp maple syrup 275ml double cream 1 medium egg, plus an extra 2 yolks 4 tbsp dark muscovado sugar 1 tsp ground cinnamon Y, tsp finely grated nutmeg, plus extra to finish For the pastry, mix the flour, icing sugar and cinnamon together in a large bowl then add the diced butter and rub in with your fingertips until the mixture looks like fine breadcrumbs. Make a well in the centre and add the beaten egg mixed with the water. Using one hand, mix the liquid into the flour to bring the pastry together, adding a splash more water if needed. Gently knead the dough into a ball, wrap in cling film and leave to rest in the fridge for 30 minutes. Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface to about a 30cm circle and use to line a 23cm loose-based tart tin, 3.5cm deep,leaving a little excess overhanging the edge. Prick the base all over with a fork, then refrigerate for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Line the pastry case with a sheet ofbaking parchment and fill with baking beans. Bake 'blind' for 15 minutes, or until the pastry is dry to the touch and golden around the edge. Remove the beans and parchment and bake for a further 5-8 minutes, until the pastry case is crisp and golden all over. Let cool, then use a small, sharp knife to trim away the excess pastry from the edge. For the filling, peel and deseed the pumpkin or squash and cut into roughly 2cm chunks. Place in a roasting tin with the ginger, trickle over the maple syrup and toss the pumpkin to coat. Cover with foil and bake at 200°C/Gas 6 for 25 minutes, or until tender. Remove from the oven and leave to cool. Turn the oven down to 180°C/Gas 4. Tip the pumpkin, ginger and any syrup from the roasting tin into a food processor and blitz to a smooth puree. In a bowl, lightly beat the cream with the egg, extra yolks and muscovado sugar. Add the cinnamon and nutmeg then pour the mixture into the processor. Blend with the pumpkin until evenly combined. Tip the filling into the pastry case and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until just set. Leave in the tin to cool, before cutting and serving. Dust with grated nutmeg to finish.

In this one, the pecans take on a lovely praline taste from being cooked in the caramel. Don't be afraid to cook the colour into the caramel, but don't let it go too far- there's a gap between caramelised sweetness and burnt. And make sure you tuck the pastry Plain flour, for dusting 350gready-made all-butter puff pastry For the filling 4 ripe dessert pears Juice of Y:i lemon lOOg granulated sugar 50gunsalted butter 25gpecan nuts, roughly chopped in well around the outside. Lightly dust your work surface with flour and roll out the pastry on it to a circle, 5mm thick and 28cm in diameter. Trim to neaten. Lift the pastry round onto a baking sheet and place in the fridge to rest for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 220°C/ Gas 7. For the filling, peel and halve the pears, then carefully remove the core from each half. Place the pears in a bowl and toss in the lemon juice. Sprinkle the sugar in an even layer over the base of an ovenproof 24cm frying pan and set over a medium heat to melt and caramelise. Keep a close eye as the sugar will turn suddenly and, once it starts to colour, stir or move the pan around to ensure it caramelises evenly. When it is a golden caramel colour, remove the pan from the heat and stir in the butter, taking care as it is very hot and liable to splutter. Sprinkle the chopped pecans over the caramel then arrange the pear halves, cut side down, on top. Lift the chilled pastry over the top and tuck the edges around the pears inside the edge of the pan. Cut off any excess pastry. Bake for 25-30 minutes, until the pastry is crisp and golden brown. Leave the tarte tatin to stand for 5 minutes after removing from the oven, then run a knife around the edge of the pan. Protecting your hands with oven gloves, invert the tarte tatin onto a large, lipped serving plate (to hold the juices) then lift off the pan. Serve with vanilla ice cream or cream.

In another bowl, mix together the sugar, cornflour, 1 tbsp cocoa powder and remaining 2 tbsp milk. Pour the hot milk onto the chocolate, stirring as you do so, and continue to stir until it has melted. Pour the chocolate milk onto the cornflour and cocoa mixture and stir until evenly blended. Return to the pan and heat, stirring, until it comes to the boil. Lower the heat and cook, stirring, for a further 2-3 minutes. Put the 3 egg yolks into a medium bowl and pour on the chocolate mixture, whisking as you go. Cover the surface with cling film and leave to cool slightly (you can do this slightly in advance and let it cool to room temperature but it shouldn't be cold). Heat your oven to 190°C/Gas 5. Whisk the 4 egg whites to fairly stiff peaks. Stir a spoonful of the egg white into the chocolate mixture to loosen it, then gently fold in the rest of the egg white. Carefully tip the chocolate mixture into the prepared dish. Bake in the oven for 40-45 minutes until the souffle is risen. Dust with icing sugar and serve immediately, with single cream.

Butter a llitre pie dish and spread the breadcrumbs evenly over the base. To make the custard, heat the milk slowly in a pan with the pared lemon zest until it just comes to the boil. Meanwhile, in a bowl, beat the whole egg and extra yolks with the caster sugar and vanilla paste or seeds. Remove the lemon zest from the hot milk, then pour it onto the egg mixture, whisking as you go. Carefully pour the custard over the breadcrumbs in the dish and leave to stand for about 10 minutes, then bake for 25-30 minutes or until the custard is just set. Remove from the oven. Warm the jam gently in a small pan (or in a bowl in the microwave), then spread over the set custard. For the meringue, whisk the egg whites in a clean bowl until stiff. Gradually add the sugar, a spoonful at a time, whisking well between each addition, to make a smooth, glossy meringue. Spoon the meringue on top of the pudding and return it to the oven for 15 minutes or until the meringue topping is golden brown. Serve straight away, with cream.

Tip the custard and mango puree into a bowl. Cut the passion fruit in half, then scoop out the seeds and juice into the bowl. Mix with the custard and mango puree until evenly combined. Whisk the egg whites in a clean bowl until stiff. Gradually add the 20g sugar, a spoonful at a time, whisking well between each addition, to make a smooth, glossy meringue. Gradually fold the meringue into the passion fruit and mango custard, using a large, metal spoon or spatula, until it is all incorporated. Divide the mixture between the prepared ramekins. Use a palette knife to gently smooth and level the surface of each souffle, then run your finger around the edge to lift the mixture away from the side slightly (this helps it to rise evenly). Bake for 12-15 minutes until the souffles are risen. Dust with icing sugar and serve immediately. SHOWSTOPPING PIES, PUDS & CAKES 234 l FLOATING ISLANDS SERVES 6 This classic French dessert was first shown to me by my mother-in-law and is simply delicious, with fluffy clouds of meringue in a pool of creamy custard.

Scrape the seeds from the vanilla pod, using the tip of a knife or teaspoon, and add them to the milk along with the scraped-out pod. Heat gently until the milk is about to boil. Meanwhile, beat the egg yolks and sugar together in a bowl. Slowly pour the hot milk onto the egg yolk mix, whisking as you do so. Pour the custard back into the pan and cook, stirring constantly, over a low heat until it is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon; this takes about 6-7 minutes. Remove from the heat and discard the vanilla pod. Cover the surface of the custard closely with cling film to prevent a skin forming and set aside. For the poaching liquid, pour the milk and water into a saute pan, add the sugar and bring to a simmer, stirring to help dissolve the sugar. Meanwhile, for the meringues, whisk the egg whites until stiff. Add the caster sugar, a spoonful at a time, whisking well between each addition, until you have a thick, glossy meringue. Use 2 big serving spoons to shape 6large quenelles of meringue. To do so, take a heaped spoonful of meringue and pass it repeatedly between the spoons, turning and smoothing the sides as you do so. Add the meringue quenelles to the gently simmering liquor and poach gently for 8-10 minutes, turning once, until just firm to the touch. Remove the meringues from the poaching liquid with a slotted spoon, place on a tray or plate and set aside. To make the caramel, scatter the granulated sugar evenly over the base of a clean pan and heat gently until it melts and turns a golden caramel colour. Meanwhile, pour the warm custard into warmed serving bowls and sit a meringue in each portion. As soon as the caramel is ready, drizzle it over the meringues using a metal spoon, working quickly so the caramel doesn't set in the pan. Serve at once.

Using a hand-held electric whisk or food mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whisk the eggs and sugar together in a large bowl until the mixture turns pale, increases in volume and is mousse-like in texture. This takes about 8-10 minutes. The mixture should be thick enough to hold a trail on the surface when the whisk is lifted. Sift the flour over the surface and carefully fold in. Finally, fold in the warm water. Carefully pour the mixture into the prepared tin, tilting the tin so it spreads out evenly and gently easing it right into the corners. Bake for 10-12 minutes, until golden and firm to the touch. Cut a sheet of baking parchment larger than the Swiss roll tin, place on a wire rack and sprinkle with the 2 tbsp sugar. Invert the sponge onto the paper, cover with a damp tea towel and leave to cool for 5 minutes. Remove the tea towel and carefully peel the paper from the sponge. Lightly score aline along the short side nearest to you, aboutlcm from the edge. Carefully roll up the sponge, folding along the score mark to make the first roll and using the paper to help. This initial roll, while the sponge is warm (before the jam is added), helps to prevent cracking. Gently unroll the sponge, cover with the damp tea towel and leave to cool a little more, until just slightly warm. Trim the edges of the sponge to neaten. Spread the jam on the sponge, leaving a 2cm margin at the edges. Roll up the sponge again, starting at the short end along the score mark again. Roll up tightly, using the paper and both hands, patting gently as you go to keep the roll compact but still airy. Trim the ends off the sponge to neaten then place the Swiss roll on a serving plate or board, with the seam underneath.

CHOCOLATE & SALTED CARAMEL MACARONS MAKES 30 It's a technical challenge to get perfect macarons but they'll taste good even. if they don't look immaculate. The key, as with so many bakes, is to be patient. Leave the piped macarons to rest so that a slight skin forms on the top. You then bake them off, pipe your filling on the base and sandwich them together. For the chocolate paste 3large eggwhites 240g ground almonds 240g icing sugar 40g cocoa powder For the meringue 3large egg whites 240g caster sugar 1 tbsp finely chopped cocoa nibs, to finish For the salted caramel filling 150g granulated sugar 90ml double cream Y. tsp fine sea salt 30g unsalted butter Line three baking trays with baking parchment. Using a 4.5cm cutter as a guide, draw circles on the paper, leaving 2cm space in between them. Turn the paper over and place on the baking tray (so you can see the circles but the lines won't mark the macarons ). To make the chocolate paste, put the egg whites into a bowl with the ground almonds, then sift over the icing sugar and cocoa powder. Mix together to form a thick paste. To make the meringue, put the egg whites and sugar into aheatproof bowl and set over a pan of simmering water (making sure the water is not touching the bowl). Using a balloon whisk, beat the mixture thoroughly until the sugar dissolves and the mixture reaches a temperature of 65°C (as registered on a cook's thermometer). . Remove the bowl from the heat. Either transfer the mixture to'a food mixer fitted with the whisk attachment or use a hand-held electric whisk to whisk until cooled and you have a stiff, glossy meringue; this will take at least 5 minutes. -~- ,- I\" . - Gradually fold the meringue into the chocolate paste, a spoonful at a time. The mixture is stiff so this will take some effort. Spoon the mixture into a piping bag fitted with a lcm nozzle, or snip the end off a paper piping bag to create an aperture of this size. Pipe the 'mixture evenly within the marked circles on the parchment. Sprinkle half of them with the chopped cocoa nibs. Leave the macarons to stand, uncovered, for at least 30 minutes, or until a skin forms. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 150°C/Gas 2. Bake the macarons for 15 minutes, until risen and set. Leave to cool completely on the baking trays before assembling. To make the caramel, place the sugar in a small heavy-based saucepan or frying pan. Over a low heat and without stirring, gently melt the sugar until it turns a golden caramel colour. AB soon as it has ch~ged colour, slowly pour in the cream and stir, protecting your hand with an oven glove as the mixture will bubble ferociously. Keep stirring until.the cream is incorporated, then add the salt and butter. Remove the pan from the heat and st~r vigorously with a woocten spoon until the butter has melted.

MATCHA MIRROR GLAZE GATEAU SERVES 8 Matcha, a special Japanese powdered green tea, gives this sponge a modern flavour and brilliant colour; you can find it in health food shops. Once mastered, a mirror glaze turns a home-made cake into something beautiful. It's all about the shine and you have to be careful to get rid of all the crumbs, as every little bump will show. As the white chocolate glaze is very sweet, it is balanced with mascarpone cream between the layers, rather than a sweeter buttercream. ----------------------~-.------------~----~--------~~----------------- For the Genoise sponge 125g plain flour 2 tbsp premium -grade matcha powder 4largeeggs 125g caster sugar 30gunsalted butter, melted For the filling 350g mascarpone 40ml double cream For the white chocolate mirror glaze 5g leaf gelatine (3 sheets Costa brand) 175g white chocolate (inexpensive Milky Bar works particularly well) 75mlwater 150g caster sugar lOOg condensed milk For the decoration A handful of raspberries lOg white chocolate, grated 1 tsp food -grade dried rose petals Small scrapes of gold leaf (optional) Heat your oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Grease two 18cm loose-based cake tins and line the bases with baking parchment. To make the Genoise sponge, sift the flour with the matcha and set aside. Place the eggs and sugar in a large heatproofbowl and set over a pan ofbarely simmering water, making sure the bowl isn't touching the water. Using a hand-held electric whisk, beat until the mixture is pale, tripled in volume and thickened to a mousse-like consistency. This will take around 7-8 minutes. Remove the bowl from the heat and gently fold the flour mix into the whisked mixture, a couple of tablespoonfuls at a time, using a rubber spatula or a large metal spoon. Run the spatula (or spoon) around the outside of the mixture and then through the middle to incorporate the flour and keep in as much air as possible. Pour the melted butter around the side of the bowl and carefully fold in. Divide the mixture between the prepared cake tins and bake for 15-20 minutes, until risen and the cake springs back when lightly pressed with your fingertips. Leave to cool in the tins for 5 minutes then remove and transfer to a wire rack. Leave to cool completely. To make the filling, whisk the mascarpone and cream together in a bowl until thick. To assemble the cake, use a large serrated knife to cut each sponge in halfhorizontally, turning the cake as you go (shown overleaf). Continued overleaf SH O WSTOPPIHG PIES, PUDS & CAKES 246 Place one sponge on a cake board and spread a thin layer of cream over the surface, starting in the middle and spreading outwards, then cover with another sponge disc. Repeat until you have all4 sponge layers sandwiched together. Spread the remaining cream over the top and sides of the cake to cover it completely, then use a palette knife and plastic scraper to smooth the surfaces. Any imperfections will show up once the mirror glaze is applied so take your time over this - turn the cake around as you spread the cream with the edge of the palette knife or a scraper and wipe the blade with a clean, damp cloth to keep it free of crumbs. Place the cake in the fridge for 30 minutes to chill and firm up the cream. (You want the cream to be set firm but not too cold or the mirror glaze might crack.) To make the mirror glaze, soak the gelatine leaves in a shallow dish of cold water to soften for a few minutes. Chop the white chocolate into small pieces and place three-quarters in a medium bowl. Put the water, sugar and condensed milk in a saucepan and heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar has dissolved. Squeeze the excess water from the gelatine sheets then add them to the pan and immediately remove from the heat. Stir until the gelatine has dissolved. Pour the gelatine mixture onto the chocolate and whisk until the chocolate has melted. Add the remaining chocolate and stir to melt. Strain through a fine sieve into a jug (this helps to remove any air bubbles). Leave the glaze to cool until it is almost the consistency of condensed milk but still pourable (at about 25-27°C, but the exact temperature varies according to the brand of chocolate). To cool the mixture quickly, place the bowl in a larger bowl filled with iced water. Sit the cake on its board on a wire rack with a tray placed underneath. Carefully pour the glaze over the cake, starting at the outside edge so that it runs down over the sides and then pouring in a circular motion towards the middle. Some of the glaze will run off the sides but if it is too fluid leave it to cool for a little longer. Make sure the sides of the cake are covered, as well as the top. Leave for a few minutes to allow the glaze to set on the cake then chill in the fridge for an hour. Decorate the top of the cake with raspberries, grated white chocolate, dried rose petals and, if you like, some scrapes of gold leaf. SHOWSTOPPING PIES, PUDS & CAKES 249 WHENEVER YOU THINK OF A CELEBRATION- a birthday, wedding, anniversary or Christmas- it has symbols attached. These always include a bake. Birthdays mean birthday cake, with everyone sitting round and the candles to blow out. I've made many cakes for my lad Josh growing up. He likes chocolate cake and some years it is covered in his favourite sweets. I make sure the cake is good, make a lovely ganache and cover it in Milky Bars or whatever he wants. It's fine to go out and buy a novelty cake, but a cake made by family or friends is always best. Or take Easter. It makes me think of hot cross buns and Simnel cake. I love the marzipan on a Simnel cake, but in some ways it's the tradition of making that cake at that time which matters. Then there's Christmas cake. I like heavily fruited cakes with the crunch of royal icing, even though I'm full after dinner. The story of a wedding cake goes back hundreds of years. When Queen Victoria married Albert, they had a big tiered cake covered in white icing and that is when it became known as 'royal icing'. Such special cakes have always been about showing off skills and, most of all, sharing. If you can get people around a table with a bake central to that- a bread, a cake or pastries, it's a way of communicating, enjoying what you eat and share. Celebration cakes and bakes are often nostalgic because they are rooted in tradition and that's something we're very good at in this country. We have a long history ofbaking that has been passed down generation to generation. Every family has a go-to cake and with a bit of effort, even an everyday bake can be turned into something special- by decorating it and making it personal to you. If you know how to make a simple tea loaf, then you can make a round one and cover it with marzipan; decorate it with icing and put a bride and groom on the top and you'll have a straightforward wedding cake. CELEBRATIONS 252 One of the first cakes that most people ever make is a Victoria sandwich. Mix it together, bung it in a tin and bake it. I like to put cream in the filling- this goes against the rules for some, I know, but cream and cherry jam it is for me. I put the jam in first and pipe cream on top of the jam in concentric circles. I also like to put plenty of icing sugar on top of the cake. You can heat skewers over a gas flame and press them on to burn the icing sugar and make a criss-cross pattern. Or decorate the cake with a pile or rasp berries or cherries, the same flavour as the jam. All such ideas take the cake to another level. Decoration needn't be elaborate. You can make a simple ganache (using a decent amount of chocolate and cream and a little bit ofbutter), pour it on and leave it to set. Melt some white chocolate and spin that over, then fan some strawberries over the top to finish. You've gone from a £5 to a £25 cake, with the minimum of effort and outlay. Always remember that a cake at a celebration can be the main event or the finale at the end of the meal; it's often what you remember, so make it good. People can go overboard when it comes to decoration; I, for one, don't know when to stop. I love manipulating sugar paste. One year, I made a Christmas cake featuring mice in bed. The Christmas cake was the bed and the marzipan was the duvet and then I put sugar paste around the outside. There were twelve mice in the bed and I set the whole cake in a box, painting the walls with chocolate and making chocolate floorboards marked with toothpicks to get little knots. I put a sugar paste rug next to the bed and twelve pairs of slippers. Then I used sugar paste for Father Christmas's footprints to a fireplace, which I'd filled with chocolate sticks. I painted a picture of mice on the walls. There were stockings hanging on the bed post and toys spilling out from them onto the floor, all made with coloured sugar paste. By the time I'd finished, I'd set up a scene that wouldn't be out of place in Wallace and Gromit. CELEBRATIONS 253 Imagination is key. Take inspiration from things you like. If you can model something in Plasticine, you can do it in sugar paste. It's like sculpture- you just have to think in a three- dimensional way. There are lots of templates you can buy these days, or draw your own, copying or tracing over an image to help. I generally recommend baking a Madeira sponge for novelty cakes and large scale celebration cakes- so I've given a recipe in this chapter. It tastes good, is easy to cut and acts as a great base for other flavours and for your decorations. A whisked sponge would concertina down under even a slight amount of weight, but a Madeira will take icing, fruit, whatever you want. It's also important to use ingredients that will keep. Such cakes take time to make and you need to do them in advance of a big occasion, so use buttercream rather than fresh cream, for example. For big occasions, I have created two stunning celebration cakes. Royal icing has fallen from fashion, in terms ofhome baking, but I love this tradition and show you how to ice a cake in this way on pages 286-9, giving the tips of a professional. When you are piping, don't overfill the icing bag. Hold the bag at the top, rolling it down as you go so you don't get air bubbles. Keep the nozzle close to the cake, for more control, and don't push out the icing too fast- work smoothly and steadily. As well as a royal iced cake, I've given a recipe for a naked celebration cake, using a meringue-based icing that is scraped away to reveal part of the cake. The style is informal but the cake is modern and beautiful. The recipes in this chapter are for celebrations with family and friends, when we want to push the boat out. Some are more straightforward, and some are my personal take on classics such as creme brule e. Others, like the gingerbread house, take time. But, of course, you can simplify the decorations if you like; that applies to the other recipes in this chapter too. Whether you go to town or keep it simple, these bakes will lift a special occasion. CELEBRATIONS 255 ···v·· . -· - ----./ / . ' i / I / / ~ / ( ' .

In another bowl, mix the flour with the ground spices and salt. Gradually beat the beaten egg into the creamed butter and sugar, then add the grated citrus zests. Now add the flour mixture and stir until just combined; try not to overwork the dough- it will be very soft at this stage. Form it into a ball, wrap in cling film and place in the fridge to rest for at least 1 hour. Heat your oven to 170°C/Gas 3 Y2 and line two large baking trays with baking parchment. Dust your work surface with icing sugar and roll out the dough to a 5mm thickness- keep it moving and add more icing sugar to your surface as necessary to prevent it sticking. Using Christmas biscuit cutters of your choice, stamp out shapes and place on the prepared baking trays. Re-roll any trimmings and cut out more shapes to use all the dough. Bake for 10-12 minutes until golden brown. Leave to cool and firm up on the trays for a few minutes, then transfer to a wire rack and leave to cool completely. To decorate, using a fine brush, paint the edges of the cookies with egg white, then dust generously with icing sugar. Shake off the excess icing sugar to leave a decorative outline. CELEBRATIONS 258 GINGERBREAD HOUSE SERVES1S Every Christmas we go away to France for a family holiday and do a chalet baking competition with other families. Each team gets a gingerbread house to decorate in an hour and I'm the judge, of course! The house will last about a week or so, over Christmas. You find the roof tiles- chocolate buttons or Smarties- tend to get eaten first; then the Flake chimney goes, and then people start snapping bits and pieces off all over the place. For the dough 500g plain flour, plus extra for dusting 2 tsp bicarbonate of soda 2 tsp ground cinnamon 2 tsp ground ginger 1 tsp ground cloves 200g cold unsalted butter, cut into small dice 175g caster sugar 2 medium eggs 150g golden syrup 150g black treacle For the decoration 9 boiled sweets (ideally red or yellow), crushed using a pestle and mortar (or a spice or coffee grinder or small food processor) 500g royal icing sugar, plus extra for optional icicles 6tbspwater 200g giant chocolate buttons 75g apricot jam 75g desiccated coconut 9 chocolate Flake bars To assemble A rectangular cake board, at least 25 x 18cm Start by cutting out the templates for your gingerbread house. You will need to make three paper or card templates: a rectangular side wall (18 x 10cm); arectangularroof(19 x 12cm); and amain wall with a triangular gable top (base 18cm, sides 18cm and then sloping into a triangular gable 29cm from base to apex). You will use these to make two side walls, two roof pieces, a front wall and a back wall. To make the dough, in a large bowl, mix the flour, bicarbonate of soda and spices together. Add the butter and rub in with your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs, then stir in the sugar. In another large bowl, mix the eggs with the golden syrup and treacle. Add the flour mixture and mix to combine and form a soft dough. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead until smooth. Wrap in cling film and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Heat your oven to 180°C/Gas 4 and line four baking trays with baking parchment. Halve the dough, then divide one half into one-third and two-thirds. Roll out each piece on a lightly floured surface to a 4mm thickness. Using the templates, cut out a front wall and a back wall from the largest piece, two side walls from the smallest piece, and two roof pieces from the other (medium) piece. Cut out two 4cm square windows from the side walls. Cut an 8 x Scm door and a Scm circular window in the front wall. (Keep the cut-out door.) Lift the pieces onto the prepared baking trays, placing the front and side walls on two trays, and the roof pieces, back wall and cut-out door on the other two trays. Bake for 8 minutes, then take out the trays containing the front and side walls. Trim the windows with a knife, or use a cutter, to remove the dough that has spread, then fill with CELEBRATIONS 260 crushed sweets. Return to the oven for 7 minutes until the sweets have melted to resemble coloured glass and the gingerbread is firm. Remove the trays containing the roof pieces, back wall and door after they've been in the oven for 15 minutes, or when they are firm. Leave the pieces of gingerbread to cool on the baking trays for 5- 10 minutes to firm up, then transfer to wire racks to cool completely. Mix 250g of the royal icing sugar with 3 tbsp water to make a thick pipeable icing and put into a piping bag fitted with a writing nozzle. Pipe the decoration of your choice onto the walls. Pipe parallellines of icing on the roof and stick on the chocolate buttons, overlapping them slightly to resemble tiles. You can also pipe semi -circles of icing on each button for extra 'snow'. Leave the walls and roof to set for at least 10 hours, or overnight. To assemble the house, have your cake board ready. Heat the apricot jam with a little water, then brush over the cake board. Cover with the desiccated coconut so it looks like snow. Mix the remaining royal icing sugar and water to a thick paste. Pipe icing on the base and sides of the front wall. Use a mug as a prop and stand the front wall against it so that it remains upright and sticks to the cake board. Pipe icing along the sides and base of the other three walls. Place them firmly on the cake board and join the edges together to make a house, using more icing as needed to fill any gaps. As you go, use icing to stick 3 Flakes on the inside base of the house, against each wall (except the front wall with the door); also stick 4 Flakes upright on the corners to act as supports. Attach the front door with icing. Leave to set for at least 10 hours or overnight before attaching the roof, storing the spare icing in an airtight container. You can attach both roof pieces at once but it is easier to do this in two stages, leaving time for setting in between. Pipe a generous amount of icing on the top edge of one side wall and the front and back gable on the same side of the house. Use icing to attach a Flake to the top inside of that side wall to act as a support. Pipe icing on the edge of one roof piece and attach it to the house. Use a large glass (such as a pint glass) to prop it up until the icing sets. Leave to set for at least 5 hours, ideally overnight; store the spare icing in an airtight container. Attach the other roof piece in the same way and leave to set. To finish, pipe icicles along the roof edges, using more icing, if you like. Photographs overleaf CELEBRATIONS 261 GLUTEN-FREE VICTORIA SANDWICH SERVES 8 I do baking demos around the country these days, and I've found that someone will always ask about gluten-free alternatives. The key to the best gluten-free flour is to mix different kinds together as they all have different qualities. The texture of this cake isn't quite as soft as a regular Victoria sandwich; it's more like a Madeira cake and tastes great. 225gunsalted butter, softened, plus extra for greasing BOg white rice flour 50g quinoa flour 50g tapioca flour 50g coconut flour 2 tsp baking power 1 tsp xanthan gum 225g caster sugar 4 medium eggs To finish lOOg raspberry jam 150g whipping cream Icing or caster sugar, for dusting Heat your oven to 180°C/ Gas 4. Grease the base and sides of two 20cm loose-based cake tins and line the bases with baking parchment. Sift all the flours together with the baking powder and xanthan gum into a bowl. In another large bowl, beat the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition and scraping down the sides of the bowl with a spatula. Add the flour mixture and fold in, using the spatula or a large metal spoon until just fully incorporated. Divide the mixture between the prepared cake tins and gently smooth the surface with a palette knife to level. Bake in the centre of the oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the sponges are risen, golden and slightly shrunk from the sides of the tins. Leave in the tins for a few minutes, then remove and place on a wire rack to cool completely. Choose the best-looking sponge for the top layer and then lay the other one, top side down, on your serving dish. Spread the jam over this bottom layer. Whip the cream in a bowl to soft peaks and spread on top of the jam then place the other cake layer on top. Dust with sifted icing or caster sugar to finish. CELEBRATIONS 264 CHOCOLATE CAKE SERVES 12 This is my go-to chocolate cake recipe, perfect for birthdays, with a rich chocolate flavour- a great crowd-pleaser and a favourite of my wife Alex. For the sponge 250gunsalted butter, softened, plus extra for greasing 250g caster sugar 3largeeggs 200g self-raising flour 1 tsp baking powder 50g cocoa powder 50g dark chocolate (60-70% cocoa solids), grated 125mlmilk For the filling 50gunsalted butter, softened 50g cocoa powder 120g icing sugar 1-2tbspmilk Fortheganachetopping 200g dark chocolate ( 60-70% cocoa solids) 15gunsalted butter lOOml double cream Heat your oven to 180°C/Gas 4.

Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well between each addition. Sift the flour, baking powder and cocoa powder together over the surface of the mixture, add the grated chocolate and fold in until just evenly combined. Fold in the mille Divide the mixture between the prepared tins and gently smooth the surface with a palette knife to level. Bake for 20 minutes, or until the cakes are risen and spring back when lightly pressed with the fingers. Leave in the tins for 5 minutes, then remove and place on a wire rack to cool completely. To make the ganache topping, chop the chocolate into small pieces and place in a bowl with the butter. Gently heat the cream in a pan until it just begins to boil, then pour onto the chocolate and butter and stir until they have melted to form a smooth, shiny chocolate ganache. Leave to cool and thicken, until set but still spreadable. To make the filling, beat the butter, cocoa powder and icing sugar together in a bowl, adding enough milk to make a smooth chocolate buttercream with a spreadable consistency. To assemble, choose the best-looking sponge for the top layer and then lay the other one, top side down, on your serving plate. Spread with the chocolate buttercream then place the other sponge on top to sandwich the two layers together. Using a palette knife, spread the chocolate ganache over the top of the cake, starting in the middle and working out towards the edges. Serve for tea, or with cream or ice cream as a birthday dessert. CELEBRATIONS 266 CARROT CAKE SERVES 8 - 10 My version of carrot cake uses more natural sugars- carrots, coconut, orange and agave syrup-for a less sweet flavour than you might be used to, but with a good balance. Unsalted butter, for greasing Heat your oven to 160°C/Gas 3. Grease the base and sides of a 20cm 200gwholemeal springform cake tin and line the base with baking parchment. self-raising flour 1 tsp baking powder In a large bowl, mix together the flour, baking powder, cinnamon and 1 tsp ground cinnamon salt. Add the grated carrots, chopped walnuts, orange zest and juice, ~ tsp fine salt and mix together well. 250g carrots, peeled and coarsely grated 75gwalnuts, roughly chopped Finely grated zest of 1orange Juiceof Y. orange 150ml agave syrup 225ml melted coconut oil 2largeeggs For the topping 75gunsalted butter, softened 150g full-fat cream cheese 1 tsp vanilla extract Juice of Y. orange 1 tbsp desiccated coconut, lightly toasted, to finish In a jug, whisk the agave syrup with the coconut oil and eggs until evenly blended, then pour onto the carrot mixture and stir until thoroughly combined. Pour the mixture into the prepared tin and bake for 1 hour, or until a skewer inserted into the centre of the cake comes out clean. Leave to cool in the tin for 5 minutes then remove and place on a wire rack. Allow to cool completely. For the topping, beat the butter until very soft, then add the cream cheese, vanilla extract and orange juice and beat until smooth. Cover and refrigerate to firm up until ready to use. Place the cake on a plate or cake stand and spread the topping evenly over the surface. Sprinkle with the desiccated coconut to finish. CELEBRATIONS 269 CHOCOLATE & MINT BUNDTCAKE SERVES12 I've used royal icing for the finish on this as it sets better than regular icing and stays in the grooves of the bundt cake. This recipe is for my mum, to make up for the time I ate all the After Eights I bought her as a present when I was a kid. I still love the chocolate and mint combination just as much as ever. 275g unsalted butter or margarine, softened, plus extra for greasing 275g caster sugar 2largeeggs 225g self-raising flour 50g cocoa powder For the mint icing lOOg royal icing sugar Y. tsp peppermint extract 4-5 tsp water 6 After Eight mints, halved on the diagonal Heat your oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Butter a 2.4litre bundt tin. Place the butter or margarine and sugar in a food mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and beat together until pale and fluffy (or use a hand-held electric whisk and a large bowl). Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well. Mix the flour and cocoa powder together, then add to the mixer on a slow speed and continue to mix for 2 minutes until evenly combined. Use a spatula to scrape down the sides of the bowl a couple of times as you go. Spoon the cake mixture into the bundt tin and smooth the surface to level. Bake for 45-50 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the deepest part of the cake comes out clean. Leave the cake to cool in the tin for 10 minutes, then turn it out and place on a wire rack to cool completely. For the mint icing, put the icing sugar into a bowl, add the peppermint extract and 1 tbsp water and mix together, then beat with a hand-held electric whisk until smooth and glossy. The icing should only just be able to run off a spoon: it must not be too thin; if it is too thick, add another 1-2 tsp water if necessary. Place a tray under the wire cooling rack. Pour the mint icing along the grooves of the cake. Decorate with halved After Eight mints to finish. CELEBRATIONS 271 ... . • J . .. -· .... ·. ;· . .

A BLACK FOREST GATEAU SERVES12 In Germany, you can't become a konditor meister, or master patissier, until you can make a Black Forest gateau correctly. For me it's all about the chocolate, the cherries and the kirsch. For the sponge 200g unsalted butter, softened, plus extra for greasing 200g caster sugar 6large eggs, separated 130g self-raising flour 70g cocoa powder 3tbspmilk For the filling and topping 3 tbsp kirsch 4 tbsp cherry jam 900ml double cream, whipped 400gtin pitted black cherries, drained and halved (about 260g drained weight) To decorate 60g dark chocolate (60-70% cocoa solids), finely grated A handful of fresh cherries Heat your oven to 180°C/ Gas 4. Grease the base and sides of a 23cm springform cake tin and line the base with baking parchment. Beat the butter and sugar together in a large bowl, using a hand-held electric whisk, until the mixture is pale and fluffy. Beat in the egg yolks one at a time. Sift the flour and cocoa powder together into another bowl, then fold into the whisked mixture, using a large metal spoon. Finally fold in the milk. In a clean bowl, whisk the egg whites to soft peaks. Gradually fold into the chocolate mixture, a spoonful at a time, until fully incorporated. Pour the mixture into the prepared tin and gently level the surface. Bake in the centre of the oven for 45-50 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Leave the cake in the tin for 5 minutes, then turn out and place on a wire rack to cool completely. When you are ready to assemble the gateau, using a large, serrated knife, carefully cut the cake horizontally into three even layers. (Keep the knife horizontal and straight, moving the cake around as you cut and keeping one hand lightly on top.) Place one sponge disc on your serving plate and sprinkle evenly with 1 \\-'2 tbsp kirsch. Spread half of the cherry jam over the sponge, then apply a layer of whipped cream, dolloping it on the cake and spreading it out with a palette knife. Scatter over half of the cherries. Place the middle layer of sponge on top, sprinkle with the rest of the kirsch, then repeat the jam, cream and cherry layers. Place the third sponge disc on top. Load a palette knife with cream. Starting from the middle and working outwards, spread cream all over the top and the sides to cover the entire cake in a thin layer of cream. Press grated chocolate around the sides and dust the top with more chocolate. Pipe rosettes of cream around the edge of the cake and sit whole cherries on the rosettes. CELEBRATIONS 275 ' A # LIQUORICE CREME BRULEE SERVES 4 Creme bnilee was the first thing I made for my mum when I was around seventeen, along with roast chicken. She thought it was very smart. I love that moment when you crack through the caramel and get to the soft, creamy custard. This one is flavoured with liquorice, one of my favourite sweets from a local shop in Wallaseywhen I was growing up. 350ml double cream 250ml whole milk 1 vanilla pod, split lengthways 125g soft natural liquorice 5large egg yolks 3 tbsp caster sugar For the brillee topping 4 tbsp caster sugar 4 tbsp icing sugar Heat your oven to 160°C/Gas 3. Stand four shallow ramekins, about 200ml capacity and lOcm in diameter, in a roasting tin. Pour the cream and milk into a pan. Scrape the seeds from the vanilla pod, using the tip of a knife or teaspoon, and add them to the milk along with the scraped-out pod. Chop the liquorice into small pieces and add to the pan. Heat gently until the creamy milk is just coming to the boil, stirring so the liquorice partially melts, infusing the liquid with flavour and adding colour. Remove from the heat. In a bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the caster sugar for 2-3 minutes, until the mixture is smooth and turns a little paler in colour. Strain the hot infused milk onto the whisked mixture, stirring as you do so. Pour the custard mixture into the ramekins, dividing it equally. Pour water into the roasting tin until it comes halfway up the side of the ramekins. Cook in the oven for 40-45 minutes, or until the custards are set but still have a slight wobble in the middle. Remove the ramekins from the roasting tin, cover with cling film and leave to cool completely. Refrigerate until required. When you are ready to serve, sprinkle the surface of each brulee with 1 tbsp caster sugar and then sift 1 tbsp icing sugar on top (the icing sugar gives shine and the sugar lends crunch). Caramelise the surface using a cook's blowtorch. Altematively, place under a preheated hot grill, about 5cm from the heat source, until the sugar melts and turns a deep golden colour (about 7-9 minutes, depending on your grill). Leave the caramel to set and harden for about 5 minutes before serving. CELEBRATIONS 276 BAKED A SKA SERVES 8 I was introduced to baked Alaska by my mother-in-law, who is really good at making it. There's a cold ice-cream interior with a coating of meringue, and it's flashed in the oven to colour the meringue. It shouldn't work but it does. For the sponge base 125gunsalted butter, softened, plus extra for greasing 125g caster sugar 2 medium e~gs lOOg self-raising flour 25g cocoa powder For the ice cream fill g 500g chocolate brownie ice cream 300g salted caramel ice cream .i' r e me ;ng•t 3 medium egg whites Y. tsp cream of tartar 175g caster sugar Heat your oven to 190°C/Gas 5. Grease the base and sides of a 20cm loose-based cake tin and line the base with baking parchment. In a large bowl, beat the butter and sugar together until pale and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Sift the flour and cocoa powder together over the mixture and fold in, using a large metal spoon. Spread the mixture in the prepared tin- this is a stiff mixture to make a firm sponge base. Bake for 20-25 minutes until the sponge is risen and springs back when lightly pressed. Leave the cake in the tin for 10 minutes, then remove and place on a wire rack to cool completely. Take the chocolate ice cream out of the freezer so it softens slightly while the cake cools (about 30 minutes) . Line a 900ml pudding basin with cling film. Beat the chocolate ice cream with a spoon until soft, to make it easier to manipulate. Spread the ice cream over the base and sides of the basin to form an even layer. Cover with cling film and sit a smaller bowl in the centre (to create a hollow in the middle). Place in the freezer just long enough for the ice cream to set - about 1-1 Y2 hours, depending on your freezer. Meanwhile, take the salted caramel ice cream out of the freezer so it softens slightly (about 30 minutes). Take the chocolate ice cream from the freezer and remove the smaller bowl and cling film around it. Beat the softened salted caramelice cream with a spoon, then spoon into the hollow in the centre of the chocolate ice cream. Cover with cling film, return to the freezer and leave to freeze completely- about 1-1 Y2 hours. --- - -- ------------------------------- Heat your oven to 220°C/Gas 7. To make the meringue, whisk the egg whites in a clean bowl to stiff peaks. Add the cream oftartar, with a spoonful of the sugar, and whisk to combine. Continue to whisk in the sugar a spoonful at a time, until it is all incorporated and you have a thick, glossy meringue. Place the chocolate sponge in the middle of a baking sheet. Remove the ice cream bombe from the bowl, pulling on the cling film lining to help ease it out. Sit the ice cream, flat side down, on the sponge and remove the cling film. Spread the meringue over the ice cream to cover it and the sponge base completely. Place in the oven for 3-4 minutes until the meringue is just beginning to brown. Slide the baked Alaska onto a large plate and serve immediately. BASIC MADEIRA CAKE MAKES 40 - 60 SLICES (ONCE ICED) Madeira has more of a chew than a Victoria sandwich sponge and is the best cake to use as the basis for a celebration cake. Cakes for special occasions are often decorated beautifully but the cake inside can often be disappointing. This recipe delivers every time. When making large cakes it is much easier to use a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, if you have one. The following recipe is used to make the two tiered celebration cakes on the pages that follow. For the 15cm cake 165g self-raising flour llOg caster sugar llOg soft tub margarine, plus extra for greasing 2 medium eggs ltbspmilk For the 23cm cake 450g self-raising flour 400g caster sugar 400g soft tub margarine, plus extra for greasing 7 medium eggs 3tbspmilk Heat your oven to 150°C/ Gas 2. Grease the base and sides of a 15cm and a 23cm deep loose-based cake tin and line the base and sides ofboth tins with baking parchment. Put all the ingredients for the 15cm cake in a food mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and start mixing on the lowest speed to combine the ingredients. Then increase the speed and mix for about 1 minute until the mixture is smooth and pale in colour. Pour into the lined tin and smooth the top to level. Use the same method to prepare the larger cake. You can cook the cakes together, ideally on the same shelf in the centre of the oven. Allow about 1 hour for the smaller cake, about 1% hours for the larger cake; do not open the door to check the smaller cake before 55 minutes. The cakes should be risen, lightly golden and spring back when pressed gently. To test, insert a skewer into the centre of the cake: it should come out clean. If not, continue baking for a further 5-10 minutes. When each cake is ready, remove from the oven and leave to cool in the tin for 5 minutes, then turn out and place on a wire rack. Leave to cool completely. CELEBRATIONS 281 CLASSIC ICED CELEBRATION CAKE MAKES ABOUT 60 SLICES This simple, elegant cake is ideal for a wedding, christening or other celebration. For a professional finish, invest in a few items of equipment from a specialist cake supplier - a turntable, a plastic scraper, an icing smoother and a straight-edge rule. You'll also need a non -stick rolling pin, small piping bags and 2mm and 3mm piping nozzles (i.e. sizes 3 and 5). As for timing, if the celebration is on a Saturday, bake the cake on the Monday, marzipan it on the Tuesday and royal ice on the Wednesday. Apply the sugar paste on the Thursday and pipe the finishing touches on the Friday. Position any fresh flowers at the last minute. 1 x 15cm Madeira cake 1 x 23cm Madeira cake (see page 281) For the royal icing 50ml cold water 2 tsp dried egg white powder 260g icing sugar (regular not royal), sifted For the buttercream 250gunsalted butter, softened 400g sifted icing sugar (regular, not royal) About 1 tbsp rose water, to taste To assemble and decorate 1.5kg natural marzipan 1.75kg sugar paste or ready-to-roll icing (in your chosen colour) Gel food colouring (in your chosen colour) Fresh flowers (optional) To make the royal icing, put the water into a bowl, add the egg white powder and whisk until dissolved to form to a milky, lump-free liquid. (Using powdered instead ofliquid egg white gives the icing lightness.) Pour the egg white liquid into a food mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and add half the icing sugar. Mix on a slow speed to combine and then add the remaining icing sugar, a spoonful at a time, until you have the consistency of soft whipped cream. Increase the speed to medium and beat until the mixture doubles in volume and turns glossy; this will take about 5 minutes. Now beat on the fastest setting for 2 minutes until the icing is fluffy. Transfer to a bowl, cover with a clean damp cloth and set aside until ready to use. To make the buttercream, beat the butter using a hand-held electric whisk until very soft. Gradually add the icing sugar, mixing on a slow speed until it is all incorporated. Then increase the speed and beat until fluffy and paler in colour. The buttercream needs to be quite stiff otherwise the cake layers will move. Flavour with rose water, to taste. To assemble, place the cakes on a work surface and, using a large serrated knife, carefully trim off the top of each so they are level. Cut each cake in halfhorizontally, using the knife. Spread a thin, even layer ofbuttercream (about 5mm thick) over the bottom half of the 23cm cake, then position the other half on top. Sandwich the 15cm cake together with buttercream in the same way. Continued overleaf CELEBRATIONS 282 Items for assembly Two 30cm round cake drum boards 13cm round single- thickness card 1.7 metres ribbon (to go around the 23cm cake and 30cm board) Double-sided tape (to stick the ribbon on) TO APPLY THE MARZIPAN Knead 500g marzipan into a smooth ball and roll out on a surface lightly dusted with icing sugar to a circle, about 27cm in diameter, turning it as you roll to prevent it sticking and using just enough icing sugar to keep it moving. Make sure the marzipan is an even thickness and that it moves freely and is not sticking to the work surface. Spread a fine, even layer ofbuttercream over the top of the larger cake (to stick the marzipan to the cake). Invert the cake onto the centre of the marzipan round. Push the edge of the marzipan towards the edge of the cake then trim away all but 2mm marzipan. Using the straight edge of the scraper, push the excess 2mm marzipan so it is flush with the sides of the cake. Slide the cake to the edge of the work surface, turn it over and place on a 30cm drum board so the marzipan is on top and level. Clean the work surface. Take another 500g marzipan to cover the sides and knead to soften then shape into a cylinder. Dust the work surface with icing sugar to prevent sticking and roll ~e marzipan out to a rectangle, 75 x 12cm and 5mm thick. Trim the short ends and one long side to straighten. Spread the sides of the cake with a thin layer ofbuttercream, wiping the palette knife clean as you go to prevent crumbs going into the buttercream. Lift the cake from the board, easing it up with the palette knife. Place the cake on its side so the straight edge of the marzipan is at the top. Roll the cake along the marzipan strip to cover the side. Lightly dust the work surface with icing sugar and place the cake on it, marzipan-covered top down. Push the two ends of the marzipan strip together and rub to smooth the join. Using a sharp knife and a short, sawing motion, trim off the excess marzipan from the uppermost bottom edge of the cake, making sure the blade is flat onto the cake, not at an angle. Put a blob of royal icing in the centre of the drum board (to help the cake stay in position). Slide the cake to the edge of your work surface, turn it over and place back on the drum board. Brush away any excess icing sugar. You should have a level, smooth cake. Spread a thin layer ofbuttercream on top of the smaller cake and cover with marzipan in the same way, but roll out 250g marzipan to a 19cm circle for the top and 250g marzipan into a 45 x 12cm strip, 5mm thick, for the side. Spread a thin layer ofbuttercream on the base of the smaller cake and stick on the 13cm piece of card. Turn the cake over so the base is on the bottom and the marzipan on top. Place the cake on the loose base of a cake tin slightly larger than the cake (this helps when moving it). Continued overleaf CELEBRATI ON S 285 TO APPLY THE ROYAL ICING Place the larger cake on a turntable. Load one side of the palette knife with royal icing and spread on top of the cake from the centre outwards to form a smooth layer, rotating the turntable as you go. Transfer the cake on its board to the work surface. Wipe a straight- edge rule with a damp cloth and hold it at a 45° angle, sloping towards you. Starting at the far side and keeping the toollevel on the top ofthe cake, in one movement pull the straight edge across the cake towards you, then turn it so that it slopes away from you and repeat, this time pushing the straight edge to the back of the cake until the icing is smooth. It can take two or three goes to getthe icing smooth and level. Wipe the palette knife with a damp cloth and hold the blade fiat against the icing to scoop off any excess in small sections, wiping the knife clean between each stroke. Load one side of the palette knife with royal icing and spread it around the sides of the cake, keeping the knife upright and fiat against the cake. Try not to overlap with the top of the cake. Wipe the scraper with a damp cloth. Return the cake to the turntable. Holding the turntable with the other hand and starting at 12 o'clock, smooth the icing around the side in sections. Keep turning the cake towards your position at 6 o'clock, keeping the scraper fiat against the sides at all times. Now, in one movement, use a clean scraper to give a smooth finish on the side, starting at 12 o'clock and rotating and scraping the side as the cake goes around 360°. Use a palette knife to gently scrape off the icing where the sides meet the top. Remove any excess from the base. Repeat to coat the smaller cake with royal icing. Leave, uncovered, overnight to dry and set. Store any spare icing in an airtight container. TO COVER THE BOARD WITH SUGAR PASTE To cover the (unused) drum board, take 250g sugar paste and knead on a clean surface until smooth. Roll out on a surface lightly dusted with icing sugar until slightly larger than the board. Use your icing smoother to rub the surface of the paste and give it a shine. Wipe the drum board with a damp cloth (this is enough to stick on the sugar paste). Slide your fingers under the sugar paste and in one movement lift it onto the drum board. Trim any excess from the edge. Smooth the edges with your fingers where the paste meets the edge of the board. Leave, uncovered, overnight to set. TO COVER THE CAKE WITH SUGAR PASTE Take the larger cake and trim the edge of the top icing, using a sharp knife. Take 1kg sugar paste and knead into a smooth ball. Lightly dust Continued overleaf CELEBRATIONS 286 I I I r I ' r I I r f the work surface with icing sugar and roll out the sugar paste on it to a large circle, 38cm in diameter and 5mm thick, keeping the sugar paste moving. If any air bubbles appear on the surface, prick them with a needle then rub over with the smoother. Wipe the top and sides of the cake with a clean damp cloth to barely dampen the surface of the royal icing (this will enable the sugar paste to stick). Dry your hands then lift the sugar paste and position over the cake. Starting on top, smooth out the icing then gently ease it down and around the side of the cake, using the palms of your hands to smooth it as you go. Trim the excess paste from the bottom edge of the cake. Take your smoother and quickly but gently buff the top and sides of the cake, going back and forth (just as you would buff shoes). This will give straight sides and ease out any blemishes in the sugar paste. Trim the bottom edge as neatly and as close to the cake as possible. Cover the smaller cake with sugar paste in the same way, using 500g sugar paste and rolling it outto a 32cm circle. Leave to set overnight. TO ASSEMBLE AND FINISH Take the sugar-paste covered drum board, spread a little royal icing on the centre and lift the large cake (off its board) on to this covered drum board. Spread a little royal icing on top of the large cake and position the small cake (on its card) on top. Place on the turntable. Spread the remaining royal icing on a work surface or board to remove any air bubbles and make it smooth. Add a little colouring and stir in using a cocktail stick until it is a similar shade to the sugar paste. Put some of the coloured icing into a small piping bag fitted with a 2mm (size 3) nozzle, being careful not to overload it as this makes it harder to control. Pipe two rows of small balls onto the icing around the side of the smaller cake. To do this, place the nozzle on the cake and squeeze the bag to form the ball, then stop squeezing and twist the bag away from the cake. You may find there is a peak on the ball. To remove this use a fine, damp paintbrush to wipe away. Put some more coloured icing into a small piping bag fitted with a 3mm (size 5) nozzle. Angle the bag and pipe a row ofballs where the small cake meets the large cake in order to cover the join. Attach rib bon around the base of the cake, using a little icing (overlap the ends slightly). Attach ribbon around the edge of the drum board using double-sided tape. Decorate the cake with flowers if you wish. To cut the cake, lift the smaller cake off the larger one, then use a large, serrated knife to cut each cake into small slices. Wipe the knife with a clean, damp cloth after each cut, to get clean slices without crumbs. CELEBRATIONS 289 NUDE MERINGUE FINISH CELEBRATION CAKE MAKES ABOUT 40 SLICES Just as in fashion, there are trends in baking and cakes. Currently nude cakes are in vogue, where you can see the cake through the icing and the finish isn't as precise as for iced cakes. The proportions of the cake are also deeper than is traditional, usually one and a halftimes the depth ofa cake tin. To achieve this you need to make one and a half cakes in each size and sandwich them together. For a really good finish, you'll need a turntable and a plastic scraper. This icing will last up to 2 days. Do not put the iced cake in the fridge. For the 15cm cake 165g self-raising flour llOg caster sugar llOg soft tub margarine, plus extra for greasing 2 medium eggs ltbspmilk For the 23cm cake 450g self-raising flour 400g caster sugar 400g soft tub margarine, plus extra for greasing 7 medium eggs 3tbspmilk For the half-depth 15cmcake 90g self-raising flour 60g caster sugar 60g soft tub margarine lmediumegg l Y. tspmilk For the half-depth 23cmcake 225g self-raising flour 200g caster sugar 200g soft tub margarine 3 medium eggs 2tbspmilk Heat your oven to 150°C/Gas 2. Grease the base and sides of two 15cm and two 23cm deep loose-based cake tins and line the bases and sides ofboth tins with baking parchment. (Or you can manage with one of each sized tin, re-greasing and lining to bake the half-size cakes.) For each of the full-size cakes and the half-size 23cm cake, it is best to use a food mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Place all the ingredients for the particular cake in the mixer and start mixing on the lowest speed to combine. Then increase the speed and mix for about 1 minute until the mixture is smooth and pale in colour. Pour into the lined tin and smooth the top to level. For the half-size 15cm cake, place all the ingredients in a large bowl and mix together with a hand-held electric whisk, until smooth and combined. Pour into the lined tin and smooth the surface to level. You can cook two cakes at the same time, ideally on the same shelf in the centre of the oven, but don't open the oven until near the end of the cooking time for the smaller one. Allow about 1 hour for the full- size 15cm cake and about 1% hours for the full-size 23cm cake. Allow 35-40 minutes for the half-size 15cm cake and 45-50 minutes for the half-size 23cm cake. The cakes should be risen, light golden and spring back when pressed gently. To test, insert a skewer into the centre: it should come out clean; if it doesn't, bake for a further 5-10 minutes. When ready, take the cakes from the oven and leave to cool in the tin for 5 minutes, then turn out and place on a wire rack to cool completely. Continued overleaf CELEBRATIONS 290 For the filling 300g good-quality jam (ideally a tart flavour such as raspberry or damson) For the meringue frosting lOOml cold water 4 tsp dried egg white powder 500g icing sugar, sifted For the decoration Fresh flowers and foliage To assemble 30cm cake drum board 16cm round single- thickness card Double-sided tape 1 metre ribbon (to go around the 30cm board) For the meringue frosting, put the water into a bowl, add the egg white powder and whisk until dissolved to form a milky, lump-free liquid. Pour into a food mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and add half the icing sugar. Mix on a slow speed to combine, then incorporate the remaining icing sugar, a spoonful at a time, until the icing is the consistency of soft whipped cream. Increase the speed to medium and beat until the mixture doubles in volume and turns glossy; this will take about 5 minutes. Beat on the fastest setting for 2 minutes until the icing is fluffy. Transfer to a bowl and cover with a damp cloth. Trim all the cakes level, using a serrated knife, then cut both deep cakes in halfhorizontally. To assemble, spread a layer of jam on the bottom half of the deep 23cm cake and sandwich together with the other half, pressing the top down firmly. Spread with another layer of jam and place the half-size 23cm cake on top with the base uppermost, creating a three-layer cake. Place in the centre of the 30cm drum board. Repeat the sandwiching process with the 15cm cake, using the rest of the jam. Putl tsp of the meringue mix in the middle of the 16cm round of card and sit the cake on top; the meringue will prevent the cake moving. Place centrally on the larger cake to check that the layers are level then lift off and position the smaller cake on the loose base of a cake tin (this is to help when moving the cake). Use a dry pastry brush to remove any excess crumbs from the cakes. Place the 23cm cake on the turntable. Place a quarter of the meringue on top of the cake and spread it out using a palette knife, working from the centre outwards. Don't worry if the meringue goes down the sides. Try not to touch the cake with your palette knife, only the meringue. Load one side of the palette knife with more meringue and gently ease in sections over the side of the cake until all of it is covered, icing the section of the cake in front of you and rotating the turntable as you go. Take your plastic scraper and use it to remove excess meringue from the side to give the cake an irregular finish; you should be able to see the sponge in places. Repeat this with the smaller cake, making sure you cover the edges where the cake meets the card. Use a palette knife to lift the cake and remove the loose cake base. Sit the smaller cake on the larger cake. Use a cook's blowtorch to brown the meringue in patches, moving the flame all the time and taking care not to burn the icing. Attach the ribbon around the drum board using double-sided tape. Decorate the cake with fresh flowers and foliage. CELEBRATIONS 293 CHOCOLATE TRUFFLES MAKES 20-30 (DEPENDING ON SIZE) When you trim cakes to make the top level, you have some spare sponge that you can quickly blitz in a food processor to turn into crumbs. This recipe is inspired by one ofmyfirstjobs in a bakery, using up the off-cuts from cakes to make delicious little chocolate truffies. If you like, you can also use some crumbs to make a crisp outer coating. 150g dark chocolate ( 60- 70% cocoa solids), cut into small pieces 75gunsalted butter 150g cake crumbs 1-2 tbsp rum, brandy, amaretto, Grand Marnier or other liqueur of your choice (optional) For the crispy crumb coating (optional) 75gunsalted butter, melted 50g caster sugar 120g cake crumbs Alternative coatings About 2 tbsp sifted icing sugar, sifted cocoa powder or toasted desiccated coconut If you want to make the crispy crumb coating, heat your oven to 200°C/ Gas 6 and line a baking tray with baking parchment. Put the melted butter, sugar and cake crumbs into a bowl and mix until well combined, then spread out on a baking sheet and place in the oven for 15- 20 minutes, until the crumbs are crispy and golden brown; keep a close eye to make sure they don't get too brown and become bitter. Remove from the oven and leave to cool. Once cold, break up the crispy crumb into small breadcrumb-sized pieces, eitherusingyourfingers or by putting the mixture into a strong plastic bag and breaking it up with a rolling pin. To make the truffles, put the chocolate and butter into a heatproof bowl and set over a pan of simmering water, making sure the bowl is not touching the water. Leave until melted, then take the bowl off the heat, add the cake crumbs and mix well. Stir in 1 tbsp liqueur, if using; taste and add up to 1 tbsp more if you want a stronger flavour. Stir well, then leave until firm enough to mould. You can speed this up by putting the bowl into the fridge once cool enough. Set out 20-30 petit four cases on a baking tray or plate. Take heaped teaspoonfuls of the set truffle mix and roll into balls between your fingers. Roll the truffles in your choice of topping and place in the petit four cases. Store in an airtight container in a cool place and eat within 3 days.
