However, evidence suggests that the Mayans learnt their knowledge from an earlier Olmec culture, around 1500-400 Be. Mayan traders would have introduced the cacao bean to the Aztecs and it soon became of huge importance in both cultures. Warriors and noblemen were buried with vessels for drinking chocolate and chocolate was offered to the gods as ceremonial gifts. Christopher Columbus was known to have brought back some cocoa beans to the Spanish court but it wasn't until later when Cortes returned from the New World that the popularity of the cocoa bean really took off. So a commodity was born that generated great power and wealth. The Spanish were credited with giving chocolate its name- an amalgam of the Mayan 'chocol', meaning hot, and the Aztec 'atl', meaning water. By the 1600s chocolate was known throughout Europe although it seems to have been its mythical medicinal qualities that first appealed to people. Chocolate does in fact contain a small amount of phenylethylamine, which is a chemical that produces a feeling of a natural 'high'. It was the arrival of sugar from America that really cemented the popularity of chocolate. Drinking sweetened chocolate became a popular pastime although still only for the wealthy.

Nuts, fruit and flavourings were added, chocolate was moulded into different shapes and filled with soft fondant or liqueurs. There is always a heated debate as to which country makes the finest chocolates. Belgium, Switzerland or France all have a good case to put forward but ultimately it comes down to personal tastes. Some diehard chocoholics would not touch a bitter square of plain chocolate yet others see milk chocolate as an inferior product, barely worthy of being called chocolate at all. Whatever your view there is no disputing that chocolate is one of life's great pleasures. J ' j C HOCOLATE GALORE COOKING WITH CHOCOLATE AA with all thin3..s, the better the ~ualitJ the better the ta..ste and chocolate i..s no exception. Nowadays the range of superior-quality chocolate available is enormous. There is absolutely no excuse to buy what they call chocolate-flavour cake covering. Avoid it at all costs. Professional confectioners tend to use couverture chocolate. It has a high cocoa butter content and so melts easily and when set has a pleasing glossy finish. However it is only available in specialist shops so is not used in any of these recipes. For the fullest flavour I recommend chocolate with at least 70% cocoa solids but in some recipes its intensity is overpowering and so a chocolate with 50% cocoa solids actually produces a more delicate flavour. If it is not obvious from the front, if you read the list of ingredients on the back of a bar of chocolate it will tell you the amount of cocoa solids present. You will also find that chocolate with less cocoa solids will melt more easily and will be less likely to 'seize'. This is when the chocolate overheats and becomes stiff and grainy. It will also seize when any cold moisture comes into contact with it. This is why it is essential to let melted chocolate cool a little before incorporating it with anything else. * .", "labels": ["Irrelevant"]}, "id": "J2wll4gykO", "from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels"}, {"value": {"start": 3255, "end": 3273, "text": "THE CHOCOLATE BAR ", "labels": ["Recipe_Steps"]}, "id": "ejgnLXVrzL", "from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels"}, {"value": {"start": 3614, "end": 3774, "text": "The chocolate is constantly moved at a temperature of between 55- 85°( thus exposing it to air, which improves its flavour and extracts more fat from the cocoa.", "labels": ["Recipe_Steps"]}, "id": "KKX1Xfbx83", "from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels"}, {"value": {"start": 6170, "end": 6930, "text": " Start off on high power but for 10-20 seconds at a time.

ThE: cacao ~SE:E:d or bE:an i,s roa,st;E:d, lE:rmE:ntE:d, driE:d and 1round l:;o l£av£ cacao (or cocoa) powdE:r. * ORIGINS * It is generally thought that the Mayans, living in the Yucatan and Guatemala in the first millennia AD, were the first people to cultivate and use the cacao tree. However, evidence suggests that the Mayans learnt their knowledge from an earlier Olmec culture, around 1500-400 Be. Mayan traders would have introduced the cacao bean to the Aztecs and it soon became of huge importance in both cultures. Warriors and noblemen were buried with vessels for drinking chocolate and chocolate was offered to the gods as ceremonial gifts. Christopher Columbus was known to have brought back some cocoa beans to the Spanish court but it wasn't until later when Cortes returned from the New World that the popularity of the cocoa bean really took off. So a commodity was born that generated great power and wealth. The Spanish were credited with giving chocolate its name- an amalgam of the Mayan 'chocol', meaning hot, and the Aztec 'atl', meaning water. By the 1600s chocolate was known throughout Europe although it seems to have been its mythical medicinal qualities that first appealed to people. Chocolate does in fact contain a small amount of phenylethylamine, which is a chemical that produces a feeling of a natural 'high'. It was the arrival of sugar from America that really cemented the popularity of chocolate. Drinking sweetened chocolate became a popular pastime although still only for the wealthy. C HOCO LATE GALO RE * THE CHOCOLATE BAR * The idea of mixing cocoa butter, the by-product of making cocoa powder, with the powder itself came about in the early 1800s. A smooth paste, solid when cold, was created that gave us the early form of what we know as the chocolate bar. It was the Swiss who refined the art of chocolate making by inventing t he process known as conching. The chocolate is constantly moved at a temperature of between 55- 85°( thus exposing it to air, which improves its flavour and extracts more fat from the cocoa. The Swiss also developed the milk chocolate bar by adding dried milk to the chocolate-making process. White chocolate is not strictly chocolate as it does not contain cocoa mass but is a blend of cocoa butter, sugar and milk solids. * Llh\\ITLESS FLAVOURS * As the flavour of chocolate improved so chefs were inspired to create wonderful confections. Nuts, fruit and flavourings were added, chocolate was moulded into different shapes and filled with soft fondant or liqueurs. There is always a heated debate as to which country makes the finest chocolates. Belgium, Switzerland or France all have a good case to put forward but ultimately it comes down to personal tastes. Some diehard chocoholics would not touch a bitter square of plain chocolate yet others see milk chocolate as an inferior product, barely worthy of being called chocolate at all. Whatever your view there is no disputing that chocolate is one of life's great pleasures. J ' j C HOCOLATE GALORE COOKING WITH CHOCOLATE AA with all thin3..s, the better the ~ualitJ the better the ta..ste and chocolate i..s no exception. Nowadays the range of superior-quality chocolate available is enormous. There is absolutely no excuse to buy what they call chocolate-flavour cake covering. Avoid it at all costs. Professional confectioners tend to use couverture chocolate. It has a high cocoa butter content and so melts easily and when set has a pleasing glossy finish. However it is only available in specialist shops so is not used in any of these recipes. For the fullest flavour I recommend chocolate with at least 70% cocoa solids but in some recipes its intensity is overpowering and so a chocolate with 50% cocoa solids actually produces a more delicate flavour. If it is not obvious from the front, if you read the list of ingredients on the back of a bar of chocolate it will tell you the amount of cocoa solids present. You will also find that chocolate with less cocoa solids will melt more easily and will be less likely to 'seize'. This is when the chocolate overheats and becomes stiff and grainy. It will also seize when any cold moisture comes into contact with it. This is why it is essential to let melted chocolate cool a little before incorporating it with anything else. * .£ELTING CHOCOLATE * I have to say I always use a microwave to melt chocolate but you have to bear in mind that microwave power varies greatly. Start off on high power but for 10-20 seconds at a time. This way you won't burn the chocolate and you will soon find how long your own microwave takes to melt the chocolate. In general it takes between 1 and 2 minutes to melt a bowl of chocolate but obviously the larger the quantity the longer it will take. If you don't have a microwave you will need to fit a mixing bowl or pudding basin over the top of a saucepan with a small quantity of hot water in the bottom. This is then placed over a gentle heat until the chocolate melts. The most important thing is not to let the bowl come into contact with the water. Not only will the chocolate overheat, but the water sputters out from the sides and comes into contact with the chocolate, which then seizes. Some people with Agas swear by melting chocolate in a bowl in the bottom oven and the few times I have tried this it seems to work very well. In some cases you can melt chocolate over a direct heat but only when the chocolate is being melted with another liquid such as cream. Never melt chocolate on its own over a direct heat. INTRODUCTION * TE.£PERING CHOCOLATE * Tempering is the name given to the process whereby chocolate is melted and worked to produce a chocolate with a glossy, even finish. If you want a professional finish to confectionery, especially when making moulded chocolate, you will need to temper the chocolate. However, it is tricky due to the precise temperatures requ ired for heating and cooling and will take a bit of practice. The simplest method is to melt the chocolate then pour two-thirds onto a marble slab. With a palette knife work it backwards and forwards until it is just on the point of setting. Return it to the remaining third and remelt it. It can now be used for moulds and decorations.

Putting the chocolate in the refridgerator melted chocolate and snip a tiny bit off the end. Then for 15 minutes will make it easier to grate. Try not you can write or drizzle the melted chocolate over the to handle the chocolate as it wi ll melt more quickly. surface. When it is on the point of setting chocolate Wrapping the end of the chocolate in foil will prevent ganache (see page 154) the heat from your hands melting the chocolate. can be piped using an ordinary piping bag and starred nozzle. * <(.UICK CHOCOLATe CURLS * First make sure the chocolate is at room temperature. With a potato peeler, peel off little curls from the edge of the chocolate bar. * CHOCOLATE CARA<GUE * Another name for big chocolate curls. Melt 120-150g chocolate and pour over a marble slab. Leave it to harden. It needs to be hard but not completely set. At a 45° angle to the surface draw the blade of a small sharp knife across the chocolate, away from the body. Turn the point of the knife a little as if you are about to trace a circle. The chocolate should form long curls. It is crucial to get the correct angle of the blade and also that the chocolate is at the right temperature. Too hot and the curls will collapse and too cold, i.e. set, and the chocolate will form shards rather than curls. BUJING & STORING CHOCOLATE INTRODUCTION * CHOCOLATE LEAVES * Firstly you will need the leaves of a non-toxic plant. Rose and bay leaves are best as they have well-defined veins. Wash the leaves and leave to dry completely. Melt the chocolate and paint the underside of the leaves with chocolate. Leave to harden and set, then carefully peel off the leaves. Always check the use by date on chocolate as some shops are less than scrupulous about their stock turnover. Plain chocolate tends to have a longer shelf life than milk chocolate, about one year compared to six months. Always keep chocolate in a cool, dry place. If it is very hot it can be kept in the refrigerator but it can become discoloured due to the difference in temperatures. This does not affect its flavour and it can be used in the normal way.

The flavour of salted butter can really spoil a dessert or confectionery as can cheap margarine. * COCOA PO(IJDER * Cocoa powder is chocolate liquor that has had most of the cocoa butter removed and is dried into a very fine powder. Whatever you do don't confuse cocoa powder with drinking chocolate. Cocoa powder is unsweetened and should have no other additives. Dutch cocoa powder is the best as it is processed to reduce the acids that occur naturally in chocolate. * PLAIN CHOCOLATE * Most recipes will specify which plain chocolate to use, usually between 50 and 70% cocoa solids. Taste different brands to find your favourite as they can vary greatly. * £ILK CHOCOLATE * There is a huge difference between good and bad milk chocolate. Try and buy one of the expensive brands and you really will notice the difference, both in flavour and textu re. * WHITE CHOCOLATE * As mentioned, white chocolate is not actually chocolate at all as it contains no cocoa solids. Cheap white chocolate can be tricky to melt and can seize very easily if it comes into contact with a liquid or even a utensil with a different temperature. I always warm a metal spoon under hot water for a minute and dry it really well before using it to stir melted white chocolate. INTRODUCTION * COUVERTURE CHOCOLATE * Couverture chocolate is what professional chocolatiers use for their work. It has a high cocoa butter content that when melted, produces a runny chocolate that covers in an even, glossy finish. E<GUIP£ENT Apart from the obvious cake tins, muffin tins etc. there is not much specialist equipment needed for cooking with chocolate. However, a sugar thermometer is essential for a few of the recipes in the Chocolaterie chapter and is a great help for other recipes. Most good cookshops sell them. Another invaluable item in the kitchen is nonstick baking parchment. Even if you have non-stick bakeware it is best to base-line your tins. If you have a food processor with a balloon whisk and dough hook attachments all the better, but it is not a necessity. To incorporate as much air as possible into your baking it is best to have an electric hand-held whisk.

Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and roast in the oven for 45 minutes. 2. Pour the remaining tablespoon of olive oil into a large saucepan and add the chopped onion. Cook over a low heat for 10- 12 minutes until softened but not coloured. 3. Add the roasted pumpkin to the pan and pour in the chicken stock. Add the chocolate and cinnamon stick.

Taste the soup and season with plenty of salt and freshly ground black pepper. Serve each portion with a spoonful of creme fralche and an extra sprinkling of freshly ground black pepper, if liked. C HOCO LATE GALORE ROAST CHICKEN WITH BITTER CHOCOLATE GRAY~ Perfect with roast chicken, Bitter Chocolate Gravy is more of a jus than the thicker traditional gravy. It is quite a strong sauce, so a little goes a long way. SERVES 4-5 1 lemon, cut into quarters 1 free-range chicken, weighing about 1.8kg Half a head of garlic, separated into cloves, unpeeled 1 small bunch of fresh thyme BOg butter, slightly softened 510ml chicken stock 1 tablespoon balsamic vinegar 25g bitter chocolate (70% cocoa solids), broken up Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1. Preheat the oven to 200°C/gas mark 6. Stuff the lemon quarters into the chicken cavity along with the garlic cloves and half the thyme. Smear SSg of the butter over the chicken and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. 2. Place the chicken in a large roasting tin and cover with foil. Roast for 50 minutes, then remove the foil, baste and continue to cook for 20-25 minutes. The chicken is done when the juices from the centre of the leg run clear. Remove the chicken from the roasting tin, cover with foil and leave to rest fo r 10- 15 minutes. 3. Remove the leaves from the remai ning thyme sprigs and chop finely. Pour off the fat from the roasting tin, leaving the juices and add the chopped thyme. Over a high heat add the chicken stock and balsamic vinegar and simmer for 5 minutes. Take off the heat, whisk in t he chocolate and stir until smooth. 4. Taste and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Wh isk in the remaining 25g butter. Serve with the roast chicken. NEW WA~S WITH CHOCOLATE TURKEO IX\\OLE You can just as well use cooked turkey in this recipe and in fact it is a great way of spicing up the remains of a Christmas turkey. Simply add the turkey after cooking the tomato sauce for 15 minutes and heat through. SERVES 4 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 1 onion, peeled and finely sliced 2 sticks celery, finely chopped 2 green peppers, deseeded and finely chopped 2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely sliced 1 mild green chilli, deseeded and finely chopped 1 small dried chilli, crumbled A couple of pinches of ground cumin 700g turkey breast or leg meat, cut into thin slices 37Sg passata (sieved chopped tomatoes) 1 Og bitter chocolate (85% cocoa solids), broken up Salt and freshly ground black pepper TO SERVE 1 tablespoon toasted flaked almonds 2 tablespoons chopped fresh coriander 1. Heat the oil in a large frying pan with a lid. Add the onion, celery, peppers, garlic and green chilli and cook over a low heat, stirring every now and again, for 15 minutes until the vegetables are soft. 2.

Cover and simmer for 15-20 minutes. Stir in the chocolate and taste and season again if necessary. 4. Just before serving sprinkle over the flaked almonds and chopped fresh coriander. CHOCO LATE GALO RE CHILLI CON CARNE A touch of chocolate adds a velvety richness and a wonderful depth of flavour to the chilli. I don't like it to be fiery hot, but if that is your preference you can up the quantity of dried chillies. SERVES 4 1 tablespoon vegetable oil 250g onions, peeled and finely chopped 3 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed 800g beef mince 2 teaspoons ground cumin 1 teaspoon dried oregano 2 small dried hot chillies, crushed 2 tablespoons tomato puree 1 tablespoon tomato ketchup 330ml beef or chicken stock 1 x 400g can kidney beans, drained and rinsed 1 Sg bitter chocolate (99% cocoa solids), broken up Salt and freshly ground black pepper Soured cream, grated cheese and tortilla chips, to serve 1.

Serve with soured cream, grated cheese and tortilla chips on the side. r----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- C HOCOLATE GALORE VENISON & CHOCOLATE CASSEROLE This is the perfect dish for a cold winter's day - rich and warming. It is preferable to marinate the venison overnight, but if you don't have the time a couple of hours is better than nothing. SERVES 4- 5 500ml red wine 2 garlic cloves, peeled and crushed 2 onions, peeled and finely sliced 2 bay leaves 2 sprigs of fresh rosemary 1 heaped teaspoon juniper berries, finely chopped 6 cloves 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 strips of orange peel 900g shoulder or leg of venison, cut into 4cm pieces 3 large carrots, peeled and sliced into rounds 300ml chicken or vegetable stock 20g bitter chocolate (85% cocoa solids), broken up 3 teaspoons cornflour Salt and freshly ground black pepper Chopped fresh parsley, to garnish 1. Put the wine, garlic, onions, bay leaves, rosemary, juniper berries, cloves, olive oil and orange peel into a large bowl. Add the venison and mix well. Cover and leave to marinate overnight. 2. Transfer to a casserole dish and add the carrots and stock. Slowly bring to the boil and season with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Cover and simmer for 2 hours by which time the meat should be very tender. 3. Stir in the chocolate and taste and season again if necessary. Mix the cornflour with 3 teaspoons cold water and stir into the casserole. Heat through unt il thickened a little. Spoon onto serving dishes and garnish with a sprinkling of chopped parsley. NEW WA~S WITH CHOCOLATE ROAST RIB OF BEEF WITH CHOCOLATE & MADEIRA SAUCE I think a rib of beef is the tastiest joint. It may not be as tender as a fillet, but the flavour wins hands down. Make sure the meat is at room temperature before roasting it, as it will affect the cooking time if it comes straight out of the refrigerator. SeRVeS 4 1 tablespoon vegetable oil or dripping 1 onion, peeled and cut into eighths 1 carrot, peeled and roughly chopped 4 garlic cloves, unpeeled 1.8kg rib of beef, bone-in 1 tablespoon plain flour 90ml Madeira 480ml beef or chicken stock 10g bitter chocolate (99% cocoa solids}, broken up Salt and freshly ground black pepper I. Preheat the oven to 200°C/gas mark 6. Pour the oil or dripping into a roasting tin and add the onion, carrot and garlic cloves. Place the meat on top of the vegetables and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. 2. Roast for 60- 80 minutes depending on how rare you like your meat. Lift out the beef, cover with foil and leave to rest for 10-15 minutes. 3. Pour off all but a tablespoon of fat from the roasting tin, keeping the vegetables. Stir in the flour and cook over a low heat for a minute. Slowly whisk in the Madeira and cook for 3-4 minutes until thickened. 4. Add the stock and simmer, stirring, for a further 3-4 minutes. Add the chocolate and stir until melted. Taste and season if necessary. 5. Strain the sauce through a sieve squeezing out as much juice as you can from the vegetables. ~. Carve the meat and serve the sauce separately. CH O COLATE GALORE ROAST PHEASANT WITH SALSA AGRODOLCE A salsa agrodolce is a sweet-sour sauce that here is enriched with a touch of bitter chocolate. SERVES 6 3 small hen pheasants SOg butter, softened Small bunch of fresh thyme Salt and freshly ground black pepper 2 tablespoons chopped fresh thyme, to serve FOR THE SALSA AGRODOLCE 1 Og butter 1 onion, peeled and finely chopped 2 tablespoons caster sugar 3 tablespoons red wine vinegar 180ml red wine 150ml chicken stock 1 Og bitter chocolate (80% cocoa solids), broken up 2Sg unsalted butter 1. Preheat the oven to 200°C/gas mark 6. Place the pheasants in a large roasting tin and ru b over the butter. Stuff each cavity with the thyme sprigs and season well with salt and freshly ground black pepper. Roast for about 50-55 minutes or until a skewer inserted into the leg joint feels piping hot. Remove from the oven, cover and leave to rest for 10 minutes. 2. While the pheasants are roasting you can make the salsa agrodolce. Melt the butter in a small saucepan and add the onion. Cook slowly for 10 minutes until the onions are softened but not coloured. Spoon into a bowl and set aside. 3. In the same pan add the caster sugar and red wi ne vinegar. Over a gentle heat stir until the sugar has dissolved, then turn the heat up and boil until the liquid has reduced to almost nothing. Pour in the wine and stock, add the reserved onions and simmer for 15 minutes. Take off the heat and whisk in the chocolate followed by the unsalted butter. Taste the sauce and season with salt and plenty of freshly ground black pepper. 4. Serve slices of the pheasant with a little sauce and chopped thyme scattered over to finish. C HOC O LATE GALORE CHORIZ09 WHITE BEAN A & CHOCOLATE RAGOUT A great time-saving alternative is to use three 400g tins of drained cannellini beans in place of the dried beans - simply add them at step 4. SERVES 4 320g dried cannellini beans '/ , onion, peeled 1 stick of celery 5 sprigs of fresh thyme 1 bay leaf FOR THE RAGOUT 3 tablespoons olive oil 2 medium-sized onions, peeled and finely chopped 1 carrot, peeled and finely diced 2 cloves garlic, finely chopped 400g can chopped tomatoes 210ml red wine 360ml chicken stock or water 1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary, plus 4 extra sprigs, to serve 320g chorizo sausage, skin removed and sliced into Smm discs 10g bitter chocolate (99% cocoa solids), broken up Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1.

Spoon into four serving bowls and garnish each with a sprig of rosemary. CHOCOLATE GALORE BAKED HAM WITH CHOCOLATE GLAZE This is an interesting and delicious alternative to the traditional honey and mustard glaze for ham. I prefer this version served cold with a crunchy salad and baked potato. SERVES 6 2.7kg piece of unsmoked gammon, bone-in 1 onion 1 stick of celery 1 carrot, peeled and halved 1 teasp00n whole cloves FOR THE GLAZI! 1 SOg soft brown sugar 90ml cider vinegar 60ml ginger wine 40g plain chocolate (70% cocoa solids), broken up Pinch of ground cloves Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1.

Simmer for 5 minutes. 4. Take off the heat and whisk in the chocolate. Season with a little salt and freshly ground black pepper and stir in the ground cloves. 5. Preheat the oven to 200°C/gas mark 6. Drain the gammon and put it in a large roast ing tin. ~. Pour the chocolate glaze over the gammon. Roast in the oven for 20 minutes, basting the joint every 5 minutes with the chocolate glaze. Remove from the oven and leave to rest for 10- 15 minutes before serving. NEllJ l!JA ~ S llJITH CHOCO LATE CHOCOLATE & PEPPERED STEAK Try and find some flavoursome, well-hung meats for this dish. Fillet steak may be the most tender, but it is often lacking in flavour. SE RVES 2 2 x 200g sirloin steaks at room temperat ure 1 teaspoon sunflower oil 1 tablespoon crushed black peppercorns Sg bitter chocolate (99% cocoa solids), grated Salt 1. Put the steaks onto a plate and brush with the oil. Press the peppercorns evenly over both sides and season with salt. 2. Heat a frying pan until hot and fry the steaks for 1-2 minutes each side, depending on their thickness and how well-done you like them. 3. Remove the steaks to serving plates and sprinkle over the chocolate. Leave to rest for a couple of minutes, then serve. Never be afraid to let any meat, red or white, rest. It allows it to relax as the juices disperse, and this helps the meat to retain its moisture. CHOCOLATE GALORE CHOCOLATEs> TO/x\\ATO & CHILLI PASTA SERVES 4 400g 00 flour (available in most supermarkets) 1 Og cocoa powder 4 eggs Grated parmesan, to serve FOR THE TO!t\\ATO CHILLI SAUCE 2 tablespoons olive oil 2 garlic cloves, peeled and finely chopped 1 tablespoon rosemary leaves, finely chopped 2 x 400g cans chopped tomatoes 1 dried chilli, crumbled Pinch of caster sugar Small bunch of fresh basil, roughly torn Salt and freshly ground black pepper 1. Put the flour and cocoa powder into a food processor and process for a few seconds until mixed together. Add the eggs and process until the mixture has formed into rough breadcrumbs. 2. Tip out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead just until the dough is smooth. Divide into four pieces. Start on the widest setting on the pasta machine and feed the dough through the rollers. Dust the strip of dough with flour. 3. Narrow the setting and feed the dough through again. Keep doing this, dusting with flour each time, until you have finished on the narrowest setting. Once you have a long strip of pasta dough, dust with flour and fold four or five times over, then cut into Smm strips. Repeat for the remaining three pieces of dough. 4. To make the sauce, heat the olive oil in a saucepan and add the garlic and rosemary. Cook for a minute, then pour in the chopped tomatoes and chilli. Season with salt and freshly ground black pepper and add a pinch of sugar. Cook for 30- 40 minutes until the sauce is really thick. just before serving stir in the torn basil leaves. 5.

FIVE DECADES OF BAKING - -·--- - --------, All my life, I have been surrounded by great baking. I've been in the industry for more than thirty years, and yet every day I learn something new. My childhood was in Merseyside and I grew up eating my mum's bakes at home- her ginger biscuits are legendary- and I was always in and out of my dad's bakeries. Following in his footsteps, I did an apprenticeship in high-street bakeries, then began working in five-star hotels. I moved to Cyprus in my late twenties, living and baking there for six years, as well as travelling around the Mediterranean and Middle East, learning about many different styles ofbread and pastry. Coming back to Britain, I set up my own bakeries and I also started to teach baking on television shows. Then one day I got a call asking me to audition as a presenter for a new programme: The Great British Bake Off So started a whole new chapter in my life. Through television, books and other forms of teaching, I'm proud to have been part of a revival of baking in Britain, and the celebration of one of our great national traditions. You don't have to go to college to make a career in baking. I learnt on the job; from reading and by watching other people, but most of all from doing. I've taught perhaps forty people how to bake professionally over the years, some of them from scratch. What matters most, whether amateur or professional, is hands- on experience and the ability and willingness to pick things up. What other qualities help? If you're making puff pastry, croissants, creme pat, bread or any number of other things, you need patience. And to be patient, you need passion. Because even if you fail, you'll do it again and again until you get it right; once you've got it right, you'll never forget. 8 The other key lesson is the importance of touch. Ifl go into a bakery, I can put my finger in a dough and tell you how that bread will come out of the oven- how it'll bake, how it'll look, what the crust is going to be like. That's purely the result of experience, which anyone can build up day by day. Get the knowledge in your fingertips. My dad always encouraged me to use my hands, and I've passed that on to everyone who's ever worked with me. Do something by hand, however much it seems like hard work, and you'll get to know the texture of what you're making. This goes for fillings and decoration too. A lot of people over-whip cream. If you use an electric whisk, you should always under-whip and then take it to the right consistency by hand, lifting the whisk up to see when it's ready. Cooks go by their own taste buds, altering recipes to suit their preferences- putting a little bit more in, tasting as they go. Baking is a different sort of skill. Bakers are scientific. You can play with the flavours in a bake but there's an underlying strategy and science. You have to do things precisely, weighing up the ingredients and getting the timing right. It's all about the chemistry, such as the rising agent's reaction to liquid, and how the salt and fat work with the flour and yeast. Fermentation is key - the way that a dough's flavour develops over time and how this is affected by the temperature of the air and water. Ingredients make a real difference too- the type ofbutter and the eggs used in a mixture and the way they emulsify. And then there's the importance of using your oven properly, taking care over any decoration and knowing the simple tricks that make a bake look great. There are two aspects to any bake: one is the base recipe; the other is flavour. Follow the base recipe to the letter initially- whether it's a Victoria sponge, Genoise, bread or croissant, don't change the recipe. When it comes to flavours, though, you can play around. You might think you need some more raspberries, 9 or cut them back, or change onions to mushrooms. But only do that after you've mastered the base recipe first and made it two or three times, so you have confidence in what you're doing. Ingredients do differ and you have to notice and respond to that as you bake. Different brands of flour may absorb up to five per cent more or less liquid. A good flour will absorb more liquid, which will give your bake more volume. Try the same recipe with different flours and you'll see the difference, and discover your own preferences. There's a plethora of equipment around these days to make baking easier. But in the end I prefer to use as little kit as possible. All you really need is a bread scraper, a good serrated knife and digital scales. A set of digital scales is the item of equipment that has really changed home baking, and is essential. I started with balance scales at work and they were fine for 20kg quantities, but when you're dealing in hundreds of grams digital precision makes a real difference. Bread scrapers are great for cutting dough and scraping it off surfaces, or smoothing icing on the top or sides of a cake. When you get one for the first time, you realise what you've been missing. I've used a Scotch scraper for forty years and I'll never be without one. A serrated knife is the most effective tool for cutting bakes. You can use it for cutting a sponge into discs, just as you do for slicing bread. Bakeware is much better than it used to be. It's worth buying good -quality trays and tins, as they'll last longer and won't warp. If you buy decent kit, the only thing you'll ever have to change is the battery in your digital scales. Baking teaches you patience and creativity, but more than that it teaches you what goes into your food. It helps you learn about ingredients and what they do in pastries, cakes and pies. It's also a family thing. Once a recipe is good, you can pass it on to 10 the rest of your family so they continue to make it. That's why it's very nostalgic -when people watch Bake Off and see a particular kind of cake, they think, 'My grandma used to make a cake like that and it was delicious,' then they want to make it themselves. Home baking and passing down these recipes has long been a tradition in Britain. We have always been good bakers in this country, but people sometimes forget that fact. I think people here are bakers before they are cooks. One reason is that cooking can be about sourcing special ingredients, whereas baking starts with the basics. Flour, sugar, salt and yeast are what we use- all raw ingredients that you have already in the cupboard. Anyone can bake, and you can start at any age. If you can get a few core bakes right - a Victoria sandwich, a favourite bread, a beautiful brioche, a buttery croissant- you will enter a whole new world of enjoyment, and save yourself money in the shops at the same time. Over the years, I've not only perfected my techniques and recipes, but also come to understand what it means to be a baker. The things I've learnt from decades as a professional are just as useful for the home baker who wants to make a weekend loaf, a batch ofbiscuits, a pie, a pud, a tart or a celebration cake. So this is what I'm sharing with you now- the recipes, lessons and experiences from my baker's life. A NOTE ON OVEN TEMPERATURE The baking times in m y recipes are for conventional ovens. If you are using a fan-assisted oven, you will need to lower the oven setting by around 1 0- 15°C. Ovens vary, so use an oven thermometer to verify the temperature and check your bakes towards the end of the suggested cooking time. 11 YOU ASSOCIATE YOUR childhood withfoodbecauseitmakes such an impact at the time. Sweet foods and other bakes are treats. They mean you've been good, or are having a good time. These are the moments that you find yourself remembering decades later. Baking is in my genes. My dad was a baker and when I was born in 1966 we lived in a flat above his shop. He would start work at 4am and the flat was permanently full of the smell ofbread. When my mum came down to gel the doughnuts she would hang me on a baby bouncer at the bottom of the stairs by the shop. I'd bounce away for hours, watching people bake. We moved to asemi-detachedhouse in Wallasey, in the Wirral, when I was very young and that's where I grew up. We were a very tight community where everyone knew each other and the kids all played outside in the street. My mum still lives in the same house, and she was born and raised in the next road. My mum hates cooking but she's creative- she worked as a graphic artist- and her pastry work and her biscuits were great. We were much involved in the church and that's where I saw a lot of cakes, bread and, predominantly, tray bakes. If someone had a birthday, we'd have a big bash or we'd go on an outing, perhaps to the seaside, and everyone would bring food to the table- my nan and mum included. Nowadays people are baking at home much more again but there was a gap of around twenty years when people just bought pre-made food. What I am part of now is a return to that ethos ofbakingyourself. On a Saturday, my mum used to make a fruit pie for Sunday lunch, all from scratch. The fruit- rhubarb, apples or pears- was always home-grown. I would climb the apple tree in our garden with my two younger brothers, Jason and Lee, partly to pick apples and partly to get onto the shed roof to be naughty and throw stones. NOSTALGIC BAKES 14 I t I ~ Saturday was a fun day; there was no school and my dad was off work so I'd get to see him. In the afternoon, he'd bake bread rolls, making dough in a bowl, shaping the buns and putting them on a tray to rise in front of a gas fire with a damp cloth over the top. I remember lifting the cloth to have a quick look. They were growing. Then he baked them off, and they were absolutely delicious. I would recognise that flavour anywhere; it's the taste of something home-made. My dad was a baker who knew his stuff, and he understood that the longer you rise a bread before you knock it back and let the shaped loaf prove (grow again), the greater the flavour. It's down to fermentation- one of the most important lessons for any baker. While the rolls were proving, I remember Dad sitting down and watching the wrestling on a Saturday- invariably Big Daddy was up against Giant Haystacks- and we'd be there, me and my two brothers. Then we would watch a bit of the Generation Game, a TV game show where novices tried to copy a skill demonstrated by a professional. At the age of six, I remember seeing a guy plaiting bread and being fascinated. Thirty-odd years later, I went on the Generation Game myself and plaited bread, just like that baker. My nans- Olive and Amy -lived in fiats above shops in big Victorian houses and they each had a minute kitchen and a pantry. The smell ofbaking always struck me in my dad's mum's house. She ran a launderette until she was eighty. Tough as old boots. She used to say to me, 'Your dad's the best baker in the country. He works all the hours God sends.' So I grew up with this sense of good baking. Both sides of the family were grafters. My great-great-great grandfather on Mum's side used to run across Scotland and back in a week, delivering and collecting the post for his community on the west coast. It was the equivalent of about twenty-one marathons a month. I didn't know that when I was growing up, NOSTALGIC BAKES 15 - I l but I had a lot of energy as a child- in double-games I would opt to run round and round a field without stopping- and later on, I regularly did thirteen- or fourteen-hour shifts as a baker. My dad built up achainofbakeries in the Northeast and as a child and teenager I'd go along with him to help out or watch the lads work. There was a very old stainless steel machine that was used to pierce each doughnut, then you'd pull two levers to inject the perfect amount of jam. Sometimes I'd do it with my brother and we'd go ge-dung, ge-dung, ge-dung, putting more and more jam in until the doughnuts became like jam bombs. My dad's bakeries were all open plan. In the front, there was the shop area displaying all the cakes and cream cakes, the steak and kidney pies, the sausage rolls and the bread on racks. Then you would swing round to a patisserie area with rum truffles and little brownies. I used to disappear off and talk to the people in the shop, to ask ifl could take a cream doughnut. It would seem almost as big as my head but I'd eat the lot. My dad would go mad, saying, 'Why's he doing that- he won't eat his dinner!' I had no idea that I wanted to be a baker back then. At the time I was just fascinated by baking and everything that went with it -the white aprons hanging on washing lines with Dad's checks, white t-shirts and long white coats. Ifl hugged my dad when he came back from work, he always had that smell ofbread. Years later, I remember coming home from my bakery and my lad Joshua saying to me: 'Dad, you smell like a loaf!'

All it takes is that little bit of ambition to have a go in the first place- and it's easier than you think. Bread-making machines can be a good way to start, as all you have to do is weigh up ingredients and then leave the machine to it. The next step is to make a loaf that you knead yourself; you'll have more control this way because when you touch a dough, you can feel that it's lively and good, and you can smell it as well. How did I learn? In my mid-teens, I'd followed my mum's path and went to Wallasey Art School, where I got particularly into sculpture. My dad now lived in York and had a chain of about eighteen bakeries. When Dad asked me ifi wanted to become a baker, I initially said no. Then he offered to pay me £500- a lot of money in those days- ifi'd cut my long hair and join the industry. That put things in a different light for a seventeen-year-old! I set out to become a baker. My dad put me to work with the best guys he had at each of the bakeries, to train me in their particular skills; they were mostly old school bakers and all great at their jobs. I also picked up the basic know-how of working in a bakery, such as not to just grab a tray but always tap it first to avoid getting burnt. Being the son of the boss means you always get the toughest jobs. I had a lot to prove, so I had to work twice as hard as anyone else. The shift started at one o'clock in the morning and we finished about ten hours later. I used to like working through the night, when it was quiet, finishing midway through the day with a huge sense of relief. But this was six days a week and it was gruelling work. I was only young when I started, and I was working alongside big stocky lads from Bootle. These lads were much bigger than me and they were lugging flour bags I could barely lift- a minimum of16kg", "labels": ["Irrelevant"]}, "id": "mvdDuYJ9ea", "from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels"}, {"value": {"start": 60091, "end": 64080, "text": "BEGINNER'S BREAD 62 r- -- - --~ I and you'd sometimes carry a couple on each shoulder when the flour delivery for the week came on a Thursday. You build up your body quickly carrying sacks like that, as well as big hot trays on your fingertips. Within six months, I was as quick and strong as they were. When you begin as an apprentice baker, you're a mixing lad or a table hand. Mixing starts with measuring. This is as important for the home baker as for the professional. If you don't weigh up the ingredients properly at the beginning- a half ounce out, either way - you've screwed up the whole process. And, just as for the home baker, the quality of the ingredients has got to be right: put rubbish in, you'll get rubbish out. The next job I learnt was to 'scale off' llb or 2lb pieces of dough on an old-fashioned scale with weights on one side and a pan on the other. You had to do it quick: bang, bang, bang, bang. There might be six or seven guys waiting to mould the dough into cobs, cottage loaves or tin loaves. After that, you moved on to the table. Moulding is a manual skill. Once you've got it, it never leaves you. Some are faster than others; I tended to be fairly quick. I am rubbish at academic stuff, but manual? You show me something once and I won't stop until I've mastered it. Finally comes the most important job- and this person really runs the bakery - feeding the oven. My first was an eight-foot oven with five decks and three trays on each one. I twas huge and made your back strain from lifting trays and filling it from top to bottom. You cannot, cannot have an empty space in the oven from the moment you start to the end of the day. Electric or gas, that oven's costing you money and you have to keep it baking at all times. You spend the whole shift juggling and figuring out where the heat is in your oven and the best position to bake things in. Every deck has its own character. You have to know where the BEGINNER'S BREAD 63 - hot spots are, the best place for the Genoise or the barm cakes. Learn to love your oven and it can be your best friend - or else it can be your worst enemy. In a bakery shift, you start with the breads. Because they need the greatest heat, they go in when the oven has been fired up. You pop the meringues in last thing, when the oven is cooling down, leave the oven door open and take the trays out the next day, first thing. Early on, I made the classic mistake of coming in, closing the oven door, firing up the oven and burning all the meringues. My dad's chain ofbakeries was what we called 'hot bread shops', designed so you could see and talk to the baker working at the back. Old dears would come in and say, 'Put that loafback in and burn it for me.' They like bread darker in the North, with more of a caramel colour and a crust; down South they prefer it lighter. Looking back, working in this type of shop meant I saw that bakers didn't have to be stuck away but could be out and about, talking about what we do. One day when I was working in the Lincoln shop, the head baker didn't turn up. As assistant baker, I took over. It all turned out beautifully. I was really proud of the cakes, scones, pies, breads, baps, harms, sticks, tin breads. Everything was great. I thought: I understand now. All it took was someone to be off for me to take responsibility and to do it myself. The lessons I learnt translate to home baking. First of all, get stuck in. Making bread is so satisfying and every time you learn more about each stage. Get a decent set of digital scales and weigh your ingredients accurately. Get your oven clean so you haven't got hot spots in there. Try not to open the oven door too often. Ideally, have an oven with a glass front and clean the front window, then either turn the light on inside or use a torch if you need to look inside without opening the door. Make the same recipe several times and, best of all, take notes of what the difference is between bakes.

COTTAGE LOAF MAKES 1 LARGE LOAF Traditionally, bakers used to bake what were called 'oven bottom breads' on the floor of the oven in order to get a heavier, tastier crust. At home, we bake such loaves on a tray and the recipe can be formed into any shape you like- cob, bloomer or, as here, into a classic cottage loaf.

This is especially important in a free-standing loafwithout a tin to support the bread's rise. Tear off a third of the dough and set aside. Shape the larger piece into a ball. To do this, first flatten the dough into a rough rectangle then roll it up into a thick oblong. Repeat this several times, getting the dough nice and tight.

After the starter has been fed, leave it for a day and the mixture should become thicker and have ajelly-like texture. Once at this stage it is ready to use. For the loaf, lightly oil a 2-3litre square or rectangular plastic container, such as an ice-cream tub. Mix the flour, starter and salt together in a large bowl then mix in just enough water to form a soft dough, using a spoon first, then your hands. Lightly oil your work surface, tip the dough onto it and knead for at least 10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Place the dough in the oiled plastic container and cover with cling film.

' '' . .. / ,; / , / , . •• ,------------------------------------------------------·---· AS A TEENAGER, I WAS LUCKY enoughtogowithmydad to some good restaurants. It was at the Chester Grosvenor that I first saw a bread trolley in a Michelin-starred restaurant. I thought: this is interesting. And I also thought: the bread's okay, but it could be better. At the age of twenty-one, I finished working for my dad and applied for a job at the Chester Grosvenor. It's a city centre hotel in a Grade lllisted, black-and-white timbered building. Beautifully decorated inside, you always feel you are somewhere really special there. As a hotel baker, I learnt a whole new range of skills and recipes. My ingredients were more expensive, I had more time and I could experiment. There were all these dainty little things that you might find in a Paris patisserie - so easy to eat and gorgeous. Before working there, I'd never made Danish pastries or croissants- there was little call for croissants in a high -street bakery in the early eighties; if you wanted to eat croissants, you went to France. The head baker taught me his recipes before he left and I've refined them over the years, partly by working with other French pastry chefs, and partly in order to make them more accessible for the home baker. The main lesson I learnt is that a little effort can make a great difference, whether it's a plate of scones or a refined French tart. Working in high-street bakeries, you'd say, 'That'll do' and get away with it. But in hotels, everything has to be consistent and everything has to look perfect. In a normal bakery, when you make scones, say, they are probably 2-3 inches high- quite lumpy scones- because people want to get value for their money. But in a hotel, that's not the case; they want finesse. One of the keys to a smart afternoon tea is keeping everything the same size. That was always critical- from the sandwiches to FIVE-STAR BAKING 112 I the scone to the petits fours, barquettes and meringues. Quality and presentation matter. Scones are easy to make so it's what you serve them with - good jam, butter, cream and tea- that sets a scone apart. The standards in a hotel kitchen are rigorous. Each day, the executive chef would get the least successful breakfast dishes put onto a plate and brought into his office. If anything wasn't good enough, he'd call me in, as head baker. I'd be criticised if a roll was a touch more tanned or if a Danish pastry was slightly raw. It tended to happen because some of the ovens weren't the best, but everything had to be perfect and you couldn't just blame your tools. At the Grosvenor, I nearly gave up my baking career. I said to the chef, 'I'm alright at baking but I've been doing it for years and I want to be a chef.' So he moved me into hors d'oeuvres, then veg, then sauces, and finally mise en place, where you plate up the food. I did that for many months, moving around the kitchen and learning from the chefs and sous-chefs. I learnt to butcher the meat, to gut and prepare a fish. The chef wanted to make the most of my baking skills, so I ended up doing two jobs for a while and working a twelve-hour day. Finally, I said, 'I want to give up the baking and become a full-time chef.' Then he told me the salary. No chance. I went back to full-time baking. However, the experience of working as a cheffor a while gave my baking another dimension. I learnt knife skills that helped me to prepare ingredients for breads and pastries, and it really opened up the world offood, introducing me to flavours and textures I had never encountered before. I would find myself thinking that I could use this or that ingredient in a loaf or on top of a cake, and that became part of my craft. Cooking and baking are different skills but there's a crossover between them that helps a baker to be more creative. FIVE-STAR BAKING 113 ~-------- -- --- -- - - -- -- Next came London. At the age of twenty-four, I became the youngest head baker the Dorchester Hotel had ever had. It's one of the most prestigious five-star hotels in the world, in the centre ofLondon by Hyde Park, and guests come from all over the world to enjoy its thirties' glamour. The staff had a separate entrance down Deanery Street. You'd scan your card and go down to a beautiful kitchen the size of five tennis courts, with the latest equipment, and all of us in brand new uniforms. I'd work ten days and have only two or three days off. I couldn't go back home all that much and I missed my friends and family. In the end I thought: 'London's not for me.' I went up North again, to work at the Chester Grosvenor for another two years. The final chapter in my hotel years came when I worked at Cliveden. This was after I'd been working abroad in Cyprus for six years and it was a return that took me to the heart of the English countryside. You'd swear you were in the middle of nowhere but in fact you are only half an hour's drive from London. As you turn into this gravel drive you see one of the most beautiful stately homes in the country; it's been in many, many films. Ittakes a good five minutes to get to the top of the drive, and when you step into the hotel's grand hallway you'll be greeted by a suit of armour, tapestries on the walls and a huge formal staircase. But the thing I love about Cliveden is that it's still like being in someone's home, and you feel as though you should be there. There was a big snooker room down in the cellar, next to the bakery. I'd go in there when I was in between bakes, or when things were proving, and my snooker improved vastly. The place was beautiful but I have to say that it was also quite creepy at night when I was up baking and everyone else was asleep- I probably looked like a ghost, covered in white flour. Looking back, why did I make the move from the high street to hotel baking? Why did I go for the job ofhead baker at the FIVE-STAR BAKING 115 Dorchester when I reached the age of twenty-four? It's always the challenge. I knew that ifl didn't go for a job, I'd kick myselflater. Stretch yourself, and you become a better baker. Some of the recipes in this chapter are straightforward but have small touches that make them 'five star'. Others are more complex, such as the seasonal Danish pastries on page 118 and the ham and cheese croissants on page 156. These require time and attention but I'd encourage any baker to give them a go. If you can make a bread, you can make a croissant dough. On paper, the recipe seems to go on for ever and ever. But when you break it down, it's not hard. It's really just dough, with layers of butter in between -that's it. Use a good French butter and that will make all the difference. If you choose a high -quality butter and take your time with the folding, you'll end up with something that's up to professional standards. If you push yourself, you'll always find that actually it's not that difficult. Shortcrust pastry is also a matter of practice. It's key to get the fat and sugar to a fine crumb, before adding your egg yolk or water. Once the liquid goes in, mix it together with your hands, pushing and binding it together gently. Don't be tempted to add more liquid, as you'll knead the mixture too much and make it rubbery. Bring the dough together, wrap it in cling film and rest in the fridge for 30 minutes or so. If you make the pastry well ahead, you'll need to let it soften a little at room temperature before using it, or you'll struggle to roll it out without cracking. You can also roll your pastry out between a couple of sheets ofbaking parchment or cling film to stop it sticking to the work surface. If you stretch yourself then you'll always enjoy the rewards. As well as the satisfaction of making something well, you have much more control over what you're eating. Many commercial croissants and pastries use margarine rather than butter as the fat, for example. Bake them yourself and you know what goes into them. That way you'll be eating the best.

To achieve the layering of the dough and butter takes time -around 12 hours of chilling between folding and rolling- but the hands-on work isn't laborious.

Tip the dough onto a lightly floured surface and form into a ball. Wrap in cling film and rest in the fridge for 1 hour. Press the dough out on a lightly floured surface with your knuckles, then stretch to a rough rectangle. Now roll out to a smooth rectangle, 45 x 20cm, to end up with a short side facing you. The dough can be quite hard to stretch because it wants to pull back into shape; one tip is to press the sides down onto the work surface to help hold the dough as you roll. Spread the butter out to cover the bottom two-thirds of the dough; make sure it is in an even layer and comes almost to the edges. Fold the exposed dough down to cover half of the butter. Fold the bottom half of the buttered dough up and over, then seal the dough by gently squeezing the edges together. Wrap in cling film and refrigerate for at least an hour, until the butter has hardened. Unwrap the chilled dough, place it on a lightly floured surface and roll again into a rectangle, 45 x 20cm, with a short side facing you. Fold the bottom third of the dough up and the top third down on top. This is called 'a single turn'. Wrap the dough in cling film and place in the fridge for an hour.

SESAME-TOPPED BUNS FOR BURGERS MAKES 8 The first burger I ever ate was at a Wimpy, when that restaurant chain was the coolest thing on the planet. Here's my recipe for home-made buns with sesame seeds on top, to make your burger special. I've also given a recipe for the burgers, as making your own means you can use good-quality mince and add extra tasty seasoning. 500g strong white bread fl. our, plus extra for dusting 7gfinesalt 7ginstantdriedyeast 40gunsalted butter, cut into small dice, softened 2 tsp caster sugar About 225rnl whole mi1J< About lOOrnl cold water 50g sesame seeds, for sprinkling Oil, for oiling Put the flour into a large bowl and add the salt to one side and the yeast to the other. Tip in the butter pieces and sugar. Combine the milk and water in a jug, then pour three-quarters into the flour mixture and turn the mixture around with the fingers of one hand to mix. Continue to add the remaining liquid, a little at a time, until all the flour is incorporated. The dough needs to be soft, but not soggy. (You may not need all the liquid or you may need a little more; it depends on the flour.) Tip the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it for 5-10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Place in a lightly oiled bowl, cover and leave to rise for about an hour. Line two baking trays with baking parchment. Tip the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead to knock out any air. Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces and shape each into a smooth ball by placing it in a cage formed by your cupped hand on the work surface and moving your hand around in a circular motion, rotating the ball rapidly. Place on the trays, allowing room to spread. Place each baking tray in a large, clean plastic b<!-g and leave the rolls to prove until doubled in size. This will take about an hour or longer, depending on the temperature. Heat your oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Just before baking, remove the trays from the plastic bags. Brush the tops of the rolls with water and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake for 15 minutes then lower the oven setting to 160°C/Gas 3 and bake for a further 5-10 minutes, until risen and golden brown. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.

The flour goes in first, followed by the salt and yeast. It's important to keep these two ingredients separate- adding them to opposite sides of the bowl - as the sal twill slow down (or even kill) the yeast in its concentrated form. Different flours absorb different amounts of water. Add about three-quarters of the water quantity given in a recipe and mix it into the flour with your hands, adding as much as you need of the rest, or some more. You learn how to feel how much water is needed through experience. For continental breads or sourdough loaves with a more open structure, wetter is better. It is easier to mix very wet doughs, such as baguette dough, in a food mixer. You then tip the whole dough out onto a work surface. If it's a dough with butter in it, I'd use a little dusting of flour. For other doughs, I began to advise oiling the work surface because so many people were coming up to me and saying that their bread was tight, with small holes and a poor rise. This can partly be down to putting too much flour on the work surface as you knead. By oiling the surface instead, you keep the dough soft, it doesn't stick so much and, crucially, you don't get any more flour going in. There is no hard-and-fast rule for kneading bread. Some people slap a wet dough on the work surface, some people stretch it. I tend to constantly roll, roll, stretch, stretch. Each of these techniques builds up the gluten that makes the bread rise and hold its shape. Everyone has a way that works for them. You then need to let the dough rise. Slower is better as it means more flavour. That's why I recommend using cold rather than warm water and leaving the dough in a cool place - even the fridge sometimes- so that the yeast works less quickly. Some of the doughs in this chapter use relatively little yeast, which also promotes a slow rise. After the initial rise, you need to knock back and shape the dough. Knocking back gets rid of the air pockets and creates BEGINNER'S BREAD 66 a uniform texture so the dough rises evenly. To do this and to shape the dough, for most breads you just fold and fold. It's a bit like folding paper: the dough becomes stronger, and the finished loafis more able to hold its shape. This is especially important for breads you make without a tin. For baguettes, I let the dough rise in a square or rectangular tub that's not too deep- an old ice-cream tub works well- so you can tip the dough onto the work surface without losing too much air. You then knock it back less, and shape the loaf more carefully. Next comes the final rise, or proving. Give dough plenty of time to prove. Again, you learn by touch when a loaf is ready to go in the oven: it should spring back when gently pressed with a finger. You want to catch the dough when it is at the top of its rise, before the yeast is exhausted and the dough stops rising and starts to slacken. For novices, I'd recommend starting with soda bread, without a shadow of a doubt. It's simple and doesn't need proving at all. Kids won't be bored and it'll take 45 minutes from the time you start to the time you bring it out of the oven. The next stage is making bread in a tin. There's only one way that a tin bread can rise, and that's up. Then make rolls and build up to bigger cobs. Finally you can get on to sourdough, which is more complex and harder to handle but worth the effort; for some it's really the ultimate bread. Once you've finished your loaf and it's come out of the oven, the killer is leaving it to cool when all you want to do is eat it. Leave it on your wire rack, admire it, photograph it, Instagram it, Tweet it, tell all your friends. Then you slice it. The time you really want your own loaf is in the morning when you wake up and remember that you've got that bread downstairs that you made yesterday. Stick a slice in the toaster. Butter, jam or marmalade, mug of tea, first bite: that's when you realise your life has changed forever.

This brioche is shaped so it has a tete, or head. One of the difficulties is to keep this bobble balanced. The trick is not to make the top part too heavy or it will crush the lower one. There's also a special technique in this recipe for joining the two balls together in a way that keeps the tete right on top. You will need to allow plenty of time for the long, slow rise. 350g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting 7g instant dried yeast 5gfine salt 35g caster sugar About lOOml warm whole milk 3 medium eggs Finely grated zest of1lemon 170g unsalted butter (ideally a good-quality Normandy butter), cut into small pieces, softened, plus extra for greasing Egg wash (1 egg, lightly beaten with a little milk), to glaze For the filling and glaze 2 tbsp apricot jam 2 tbsp pearl sugar 200g lemon curd As this is a wet dough with lots ofbutter, I'd highly recommend using a food mixer if possible. Put the flour into a food mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add the yeast to one side of the bowl and the salt and sugar to the other. Now add the milk, eggs and lemon zest and mix on a slow speed for 2 minutes, then on a medium speed for a further 6-8 minutes until you have a soft, glossy, elastic dough. Add the butter pieces and continue to mix for a further 4-5 minutes, scraping down the bowl periodically to ensure that the butter is fully incorporated. The dough will be very soft. Tip the dough into a plastic bowl, cover with cling film and chill for at least 7 hours, or overnight, until it has firmed up and you are able to shape it. Grease a 22cm brioche tin with butter. Take the brioche dough from the fridge. Tip it onto a lightly floured surface and fold it in on itself a few times to knock out the air. Tear off a piece of the dough (about 125g in weight) and shape it into a smooth ball by placing it in a cage formed by your cupped hand on the work surface and moving your hand around in a circular motion, rotating the ball rapidly. Take the larger piece of dough and form it into a smooth, tight ball by cupping it with the sides of your hands and turning it around to create a smooth ball. Press gently to flatten slightly.", "labels": ["Relevant"]}, "id": "fzvLxLZ2ff", "from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels"}, {"value": {"start": 154822, "end": 156824, "text": "Dust your middle finger and forefinger with flour and push them through the centre of the larger ball of dough to make a hole (or use the end of a wooden spoon). Now stretch the hole so the ball looks like a tall ring doughnut. Shape the smaller ball into a cylinder and taper one end. Using a knife, slice the bottom half of the tapered end vertically in two, keeping the top half intact. Pull the two ends apart then insert these tapered ends through the hole in the large ball and tuck them outwards underneath the large ball. Form the top of the cylinder into a ball. (This technique keeps the small ball of dough in place when it's baked, otherwise it can tip to the side and won't stay in the middle.) Push the handle of a wooden spoon down through both balls right to the base. This will help the brioche to cook all the way through. Place the brioche in the prepared tin and stand it on a baking tray. Place inside a large, clean plastic bag and leave to prove for 2-3 hours, or until doubled in size. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 190°C/Gas 5. Remove the tray from the plastic bag. Brush the brioche with egg wash and bake for 25- 30 minutes, until risen and golden brown. Note that the sugar and butter will make the brioche colour before it is fully baked. To check it is cooked, carefully tip the brioche out of its tin and tap the bottom: it should sound hollow. If not, return it to the tin and bake for a further 5 minutes. But keep a close eye- if you overcook the brioche, it will become dry. Leave the brioche in its tin for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, gently heat the apricot jam with a little water, then press through a sieve. Brush the top of the brioche with the apricot glaze and sprinkle with the pearl sugar. Remove the brioche from the tin and place on a wire rack. Leave to cool. Spoon the lemon curd into a piping bag fitted with a bismarck nozzle (for filling doughnuts) and inject the brioche from the top with the lemon curd to fill the centre with it.

The recipe looks long but once you understand the process, it's just a matter of repeating stages that don't take much time. A croissant is all about the layers. Make sure you chill the dough well and roll it out to exactly the same level each time so you don't get more butter in some parts and end up with bread rather than a properly flaky croissant. You'll need to allow around 20 hours in total for chilling the dough. 350g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting 150g plain flour lOg instant dried yeast lOg fine salt 80g caster sugar 280mlwater 300g unsalted butter (ideally a good-quality Normandy butter), softened 120g ham, thinly sliced 200gmature Cheddar, grated 1 egg, beaten, to glaze Put both flours into a food mixer fitted with the dough hook. Add the yeast to one side and the salt and sugar to the other an,d begin mixing on a slow speed. Add the water and mix for a couple of minutes to bring the dough together. Increase the speed and mix for a further 6 minutes. The dough should be fairly stiff. (You can make this dough by hand but I'd recommend using a mixer if possible.) Lift the dough onto a lightly floured surface and form into a ball. Put into a greased bowl, cover with cling film and leave to rest in the fridge for atleast 8 hours, or overnight. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to a rectangle, 60 x 20cm, to end up with a short side facing you. The dough can be quite hard to stretch because it wants to pull back into shape; one tip is to press the sides down onto the work surface to help hold the dough as you roll. Spread the butter out to cover the bottom two-thirds of the dough; make sure it is in an even layer and comes almost to the edges. Fold the exposed dough down to cover half of the butter. Fold the bottom half of the buttered dough up and over, then seal the dough by gently squeezing the edges together. Wrap in cling film and refrigerate for at least an hour, until the butter has hardened. Unwrap the chilled dough, place it on a lightly floured surface and roll again into a rectangle, 45 x 20cm, with a short side facing you.

Repeat this stage three more times, chilling the dough in between turns. Write the number of turns on the cling film with a mar kerpen, as a reminder. After the final tum, wrap the dough in cling film and chill for at least 8 hours, or overnight, to rest and rise slightly. When you are ready to shape the croissants, line two or three baking trays with baking parchment. Place the chilled dough on a lightly floured surface and roll into a rectangle, 42 x 30cm, with a short side facing you. Trim the edges to neaten. Cut the rectangle in two lengthways, then cut triangles along the length of each strip (a pizza wheelis a good tool for this job). The base of each triangle should be about 12cm wide and it should be about15cm high. You will get 6 triangles from each strip (you'll need to trim off a small triangular piece from each end). Cut the ham into pieces that are roughly the same size as the dough triangles. Place a piece of ham on each triangle and sprinkle over some grated cheese. Hold the wide base of the triangle and gently tug the pointed opposite end to cause slight tension in the dough. Starting at the thick end, roll up into a croissant shape. Place the croissants on the prepared trays, leaving space in between for them to expand. Place each tray in a large, clean plastic bag and leave to prove at room temperature for 2 hours, or until the croissants have doubled in size.

You then bake them off, pipe your filling on the base and sandwich them together. For the chocolate paste 3large eggwhites 240g ground almonds 240g icing sugar 40g cocoa powder For the meringue 3large egg whites 240g caster sugar 1 tbsp finely chopped cocoa nibs, to finish For the salted caramel filling 150g granulated sugar 90ml double cream Y. tsp fine sea salt 30g unsalted butter Line three baking trays with baking parchment. Using a 4.5cm cutter as a guide, draw circles on the paper, leaving 2cm space in between them. Turn the paper over and place on the baking tray (so you can see the circles but the lines won't mark the macarons ). To make the chocolate paste, put the egg whites into a bowl with the ground almonds, then sift over the icing sugar and cocoa powder. Mix together to form a thick paste. To make the meringue, put the egg whites and sugar into aheatproof bowl and set over a pan of simmering water (making sure the water is not touching the bowl). Using a balloon whisk, beat the mixture thoroughly until the sugar dissolves and the mixture reaches a temperature of 65°C (as registered on a cook's thermometer). . Remove the bowl from the heat.

Once mastered, a mirror glaze turns a home-made cake into something beautiful. It's all about the shine and you have to be careful to get rid of all the crumbs, as every little bump will show.

Place the cake in the fridge for 30 minutes to chill and firm up the cream. (You want the cream to be set firm but not too cold or the mirror glaze might crack.) To make the mirror glaze, soak the gelatine leaves in a shallow dish of cold water to soften for a few minutes. Chop the white chocolate into small pieces and place three-quarters in a medium bowl. Put the water, sugar and condensed milk in a saucepan and heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar has dissolved.

BASIC MADEIRA CAKE MAKES 40 - 60 SLICES (ONCE ICED) Madeira has more of a chew than a Victoria sandwich sponge and is the best cake to use as the basis for a celebration cake. Cakes for special occasions are often decorated beautifully but the cake inside can often be disappointing. This recipe delivers every time. When making large cakes it is much easier to use a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, if you have one. The following recipe is used to make the two tiered celebration cakes on the pages that follow. For the 15cm cake 165g self-raising flour llOg caster sugar llOg soft tub margarine, plus extra for greasing 2 medium eggs ltbspmilk For the 23cm cake 450g self-raising flour 400g caster sugar 400g soft tub margarine, plus extra for greasing 7 medium eggs 3tbspmilk Heat your oven to 150°C/ Gas 2. Grease the base and sides of a 15cm and a 23cm deep loose-based cake tin and line the base and sides ofboth tins with baking parchment. Put all the ingredients for the 15cm cake in a food mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and start mixing on the lowest speed to combine the ingredients. Then increase the speed and mix for about 1 minute until the mixture is smooth and pale in colour. Pour into the lined tin and smooth the top to level. Use the same method to prepare the larger cake. You can cook the cakes together, ideally on the same shelf in the centre of the oven. Allow about 1 hour for the smaller cake, about 1% hours for the larger cake; do not open the door to check the smaller cake before 55 minutes. The cakes should be risen, lightly golden and spring back when pressed gently. To test, insert a skewer into the centre of the cake: it should come out clean. If not, continue baking for a further 5-10 minutes. When each cake is ready, remove from the oven and leave to cool in the tin for 5 minutes, then turn out and place on a wire rack. Leave to cool completely. CELEBRATIONS 281 CLASSIC ICED CELEBRATION CAKE MAKES ABOUT 60 SLICES This simple, elegant cake is ideal for a wedding, christening or other celebration. For a professional finish, invest in a few items of equipment from a specialist cake supplier - a turntable, a plastic scraper, an icing smoother and a straight-edge rule. You'll also need a non -stick rolling pin, small piping bags and 2mm and 3mm piping nozzles (i.e. sizes 3 and 5). As for timing, if the celebration is on a Saturday, bake the cake on the Monday, marzipan it on the Tuesday and royal ice on the Wednesday. Apply the sugar paste on the Thursday and pipe the finishing touches on the Friday. Position any fresh flowers at the last minute. 1 x 15cm Madeira cake 1 x 23cm Madeira cake (see page 281) For the royal icing 50ml cold water 2 tsp dried egg white powder 260g icing sugar (regular not royal), sifted For the buttercream 250gunsalted butter, softened 400g sifted icing sugar (regular, not royal) About 1 tbsp rose water, to taste To assemble and decorate 1.5kg natural marzipan 1.75kg sugar paste or ready-to-roll icing (in your chosen colour) Gel food colouring (in your chosen colour) Fresh flowers (optional) To make the royal icing, put the water into a bowl, add the egg white powder and whisk until dissolved to form to a milky, lump-free liquid. (Using powdered instead ofliquid egg white gives the icing lightness.) Pour the egg white liquid into a food mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and add half the icing sugar. Mix on a slow speed to combine and then add the remaining icing sugar, a spoonful at a time, until you have the consistency of soft whipped cream. Increase the speed to medium and beat until the mixture doubles in volume and turns glossy; this will take about 5 minutes. Now beat on the fastest setting for 2 minutes until the icing is fluffy. Transfer to a bowl, cover with a clean damp cloth and set aside until ready to use. To make the buttercream, beat the butter using a hand-held electric whisk until very soft. Gradually add the icing sugar, mixing on a slow speed until it is all incorporated. Then increase the speed and beat until fluffy and paler in colour. The buttercream needs to be quite stiff otherwise the cake layers will move. Flavour with rose water, to taste. To assemble, place the cakes on a work surface and, using a large serrated knife, carefully trim off the top of each so they are level. Cut each cake in halfhorizontally, using the knife.

Make sure the marzipan is an even thickness and that it moves freely and is not sticking to the work surface. Spread a fine, even layer ofbuttercream over the top of the larger cake (to stick the marzipan to the cake). Invert the cake onto the centre of the marzipan round. Push the edge of the marzipan towards the edge of the cake then trim away all but 2mm marzipan. Using the straight edge of the scraper, push the excess 2mm marzipan so it is flush with the sides of the cake. Slide the cake to the edge of the work surface, turn it over and place on a 30cm drum board so the marzipan is on top and level. Clean the work surface.

Load one side of the palette knife with royal icing and spread it around the sides of the cake, keeping the knife upright and fiat against the cake. Try not to overlap with the top of the cake. Wipe the scraper with a damp cloth. Return the cake to the turntable. Holding the turntable with the other hand and starting at 12 o'clock, smooth the icing around the side in sections. Keep turning the cake towards your position at 6 o'clock, keeping the scraper fiat against the sides at all times.

Use a palette knife to gently scrape off the icing where the sides meet the top. Remove any excess from the base. Repeat to coat the smaller cake with royal icing. Leave, uncovered, overnight to dry and set. Store any spare icing in an airtight container. TO COVER THE BOARD WITH SUGAR PASTE To cover the (unused) drum board, take 250g sugar paste and knead on a clean surface until smooth. Roll out on a surface lightly dusted with icing sugar until slightly larger than the board. Use your icing smoother to rub the surface of the paste and give it a shine. Wipe the drum board with a damp cloth (this is enough to stick on the sugar paste). Slide your fingers under the sugar paste and in one movement lift it onto the drum board.

Dry your hands then lift the sugar paste and position over the cake. Starting on top, smooth out the icing then gently ease it down and around the side of the cake, using the palms of your hands to smooth it as you go. Trim the excess paste from the bottom edge of the cake. Take your smoother and quickly but gently buff the top and sides of the cake, going back and forth (just as you would buff shoes).

This brioche is shaped so it has a tete, or head. One of the difficulties is to keep this bobble balanced. The trick is not to make the top part too heavy or it will crush the lower one. There's also a special technique in this recipe for joining the two balls together in a way that keeps the tete right on top. You will need to allow plenty of time for the long, slow rise. 350g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting 7g instant dried yeast 5gfine salt 35g caster sugar About lOOml warm whole milk 3 medium eggs Finely grated zest of1lemon 170g unsalted butter (ideally a good-quality Normandy butter), cut into small pieces, softened, plus extra for greasing Egg wash (1 egg, lightly beaten with a little milk), to glaze For the filling and glaze 2 tbsp apricot jam 2 tbsp pearl sugar 200g lemon curd As this is a wet dough with lots ofbutter, I'd highly recommend using a food mixer if possible. Put the flour into a food mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add the yeast to one side of the bowl and the salt and sugar to the other. Now add the milk, eggs and lemon zest and mix on a slow speed for 2 minutes, then on a medium speed for a further 6-8 minutes until you have a soft, glossy, elastic dough. Add the butter pieces and continue to mix for a further 4-5 minutes, scraping down the bowl periodically to ensure that the butter is fully incorporated. The dough will be very soft. Tip the dough into a plastic bowl, cover with cling film and chill for at least 7 hours, or overnight, until it has firmed up and you are able to shape it. Grease a 22cm brioche tin with butter. Take the brioche dough from the fridge. Tip it onto a lightly floured surface and fold it in on itself a few times to knock out the air. Tear off a piece of the dough (about 125g in weight) and shape it into a smooth ball by placing it in a cage formed by your cupped hand on the work surface and moving your hand around in a circular motion, rotating the ball rapidly. Take the larger piece of dough and form it into a smooth, tight ball by cupping it with the sides of your hands and turning it around to create a smooth ball.

Now stretch the hole so the ball looks like a tall ring doughnut. Shape the smaller ball into a cylinder and taper one end. Using a knife, slice the bottom half of the tapered end vertically in two, keeping the top half intact. Pull the two ends apart then insert these tapered ends through the hole in the large ball and tuck them outwards underneath the large ball. Form the top of the cylinder into a ball. (This technique keeps the small ball of dough in place when it's baked, otherwise it can tip to the side and won't stay in the middle.) Push the handle of a wooden spoon down through both balls right to the base. This will help the brioche to cook all the way through. Place the brioche in the prepared tin and stand it on a baking tray. Place inside a large, clean plastic bag and leave to prove for 2-3 hours, or until doubled in size. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 190°C/Gas 5. Remove the tray from the plastic bag. Brush the brioche with egg wash and bake for 25- 30 minutes, until risen and golden brown. Note that the sugar and butter will make the brioche colour before it is fully baked. To check it is cooked, carefully tip the brioche out of its tin and tap the bottom: it should sound hollow. If not, return it to the tin and bake for a further 5 minutes. But keep a close eye- if you overcook the brioche, it will become dry. Leave the brioche in its tin for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, gently heat the apricot jam with a little water, then press through a sieve. Brush the top of the brioche with the apricot glaze and sprinkle with the pearl sugar. Remove the brioche from the tin and place on a wire rack. Leave to cool.

Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to a rectangle, 60 x 20cm, to end up with a short side facing you. The dough can be quite hard to stretch because it wants to pull back into shape; one tip is to press the sides down onto the work surface to help hold the dough as you roll. Spread the butter out to cover the bottom two-thirds of the dough; make sure it is in an even layer and comes almost to the edges. Fold the exposed dough down to cover half of the butter. Fold the bottom half of the buttered dough up and over, then seal the dough by gently squeezing the edges together. Wrap in cling film and refrigerate for at least an hour, until the butter has hardened. Unwrap the chilled dough, place it on a lightly floured surface and roll again into a rectangle, 45 x 20cm, with a short side facing you.

After the final tum, wrap the dough in cling film and chill for at least 8 hours, or overnight, to rest and rise slightly. When you are ready to shape the croissants, line two or three baking trays with baking parchment. Place the chilled dough on a lightly floured surface and roll into a rectangle, 42 x 30cm, with a short side facing you. Trim the edges to neaten. Cut the rectangle in two lengthways, then cut triangles along the length of each strip (a pizza wheelis a good tool for this job). The base of each triangle should be about 12cm wide and it should be about15cm high. You will get 6 triangles from each strip (you'll need to trim off a small triangular piece from each end). Cut the ham into pieces that are roughly the same size as the dough triangles. Place a piece of ham on each triangle and sprinkle over some grated cheese. Hold the wide base of the triangle and gently tug the pointed opposite end to cause slight tension in the dough. Starting at the thick end, roll up into a croissant shape. Place the croissants on the prepared trays, leaving space in between for them to expand. Place each tray in a large, clean plastic bag and leave to prove at room temperature for 2 hours, or until the croissants have doubled in size. (If you want to make these in advance, wrap each croissant in cling film before it proves, and freeze. Thaw and prove in the morning for a mid-morning brunch.) Heat your oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Take the trays of croissants out of the bags. Just before baking, brush the croissants with egg wash. Bake for 15 minutes, then lower the oven setting to 180°C/Gas 4 and bake for a further 5 minutes, until risen and golden. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.

In recent years, the range of ingredients available in this country has exploded, making exotic recipes much more accessible. Most of what you need can be found in supermarkets and delis, or else is easily available online. My travels in baking really began in my late twenties, when I was approached about working as a head baker for a hotel in Cyprus. The guests at the time were mainly from Europe and the hotel needed someone to show the Cypriot guys how European baking worked. Most bakers who went out there stayed six months. I fell in love with the place and stayed for six years. Going to Cyprus was a massive change from life in the north ofEngland. It was very hot in the bakery so we just wore shorts. I got on with the lifestyle and the people, and I made a lot of new friends. Most importantly, I met my wife Alex out there- she was working in the hotel- and we got married in the oldest Christian church on the island. The hotel where I worked is called the Annabelle and it's like something out of a dream: swimming pools, the view of the sea, the heat. Even in winter, it's 25°C when the sun's out. I soon started to pick up the Cypriot way ofbaking. They still make bread at home in the beehive ovens you see all over the island; every family has one in the garden. They're like the outdoor ovens you find in Italy, with an arched opening and a domed interior. They fire the oven up with loads of wood and once the brick starts turning white, you push the wood and ash to one side, mop it out, get a big bunch of oregano tied to a stick and brush the inside of the oven, so the herbs infuse the oven and all your breads. Cypriot families get together on a Sunday- the teenagers, the grandparents, everyone. They might work in the city but BAKES OF THE WORLD 162 I t • I • I • at the weekend they go back to their village to see their yay as - grandmothers- and their mothers. It's all about food, and bread baked in the oven is the centre of that. Like olives, halloumi and feta, it's a celebration of their area. Cyprus has got a Greek aspect, obviously, but it also has a great influence from the Middle East. When I lived in Cyprus, it wasn't part of the EU and I had to leave the country every six months to go and get a stamp on my visa, so I did a lot of travelling in the Middle East, finding out about different ways ofbaking. First I travelled to Jordan to check out their flatbreads. I remember going to the walled city of Petra and coming across a Bedouin woman squatting down on the ground next to a fire, making breads on a small metal dome. As she demonstrated how to make bread in this very basic way I realised that, essentially, nothing in this method had changed for thousands of years. Then I went to Egypt, and there I was fascinated by the tarts and puddings made with set milk or cream. They've often got mastika, or mastic, in there. This is a dried tree resin with the aniseed flavour that runs through many of the bakes in the Middle East, and also Cyprus, and it is one of the more unusual ingredients that I've included in this chapter. The ovens were similar to the ones in Cyprus, except a bit more square and longer, in order to get more into them. Being abroad is about digging around to discover why people eat what they do. In the Middle East, how do you bake when the temperatures are so extreme? You have to adapt your recipes to make them work. What flours do they have? The soils of the Middle East mean the flour is less strong- with less protein to make it rise- and so they make flatbreads . Because many people in the Middle East used to be nomadic, they didn't stay in one place for long enough to build an oven, and kept the bread-making pretty simple. When they did build ovens, they were more like furnaces than our Western ovens. BAKES OF THE WORLD 163 It's all about getting very high temperatures when it comes to flatbreads -the thinner the bread, the faster you want to cook it to stop it drying out. When I travel, I try flavours, I try techniques. I think about the bakes people ate historically and then see how that leads up to what they eat today. There are the differences between countries, and then there are the connections. Just look at the variations on the same ingredients: you think of fruit cake and hot cross buns in Britain but you also find fruited buns and loaves in Italy, France, Norway, Sweden. The methods have changed slightly but the basic recipe is instantly recognisable. Some of these connections go way back. Archaeologists have found sourdough spores in the large ceramic pots they used for bread-making in Ancient Egypt; this style ofbaking, so popular again these days, has long roots. Back in this country, London is one of the world's most important centres offood, thanks to the city's diversity and the huge number of chefs. It's a melting pot offood cultures and top-quality cooking- from Mexican to Indian to Middle Eastern. You can take all these flavour combinations into baking, both savoury and sweet. You can also learn different techniques, though they're not always easy. I once had a go at cooking naan bread in a tandoor in an Indian restaurant and nearly scalded my eyebrows off it was so hot! When I went to work in the Mediterranean, I fell in love with baking all over again. I still travel and bake today. You always discover another approach to food in other countries and different slants on the familiar- flavours, methods, proving, baking. It keeps you learning.

BAKES OF THE WORLD 204 A RETURN TO BRITISH BAKING TELEVISION IS A DIFFERENT WAY ofteaching.Peopleliketo be entertained as they learn- you know that from back at school and the teachers who made you want to listen. I want viewers to get little nuggets that they can take back to the kitchen and use. When I came back to live in Britain in 1999, I started to run my own bakeries and at the same time began to appear on Tv. I'm not quite sure why but being in front of a camera came naturally. The advice is always to be yourself. I'm not an actor so it was straightforward to do just that. It was 2010 when I got a call from Love Productions telling me about a new programme they were making. Would I be interested in auditioning? Someone from the production team came to my house, tipped out a bag ofbakes and said: judge them. Then I met my fellow presenters and it all fell into place. You cannot fake chemistry; it happens from day one. The programme really started to take shape in the first series. In the original Bake Offline up, Mary was everyone's grandma, including mine. She was from the tradition ofhome baking. I was used to dealing in 20kg of flour for making batches ofbread, while Mary thinks in grams. She was the comforting arm around the shoulder while I was more the teacher who said, 'I think you should do this, see me afterwards.' My job was to be a straight, honest and fair judge. You have to give constructive criticism so the contestants learn. Bake Off is ajourney for them, just as baking has been for me in my own life. Mel and Sue were the gel between us all who kept us sane. They lightened the mood and everyone was happier for it. But Bake Off is not about the hosts and the judges, it's about the bakers- they are the stars of the show. It's important for them to manage their time properly in order to succeed- and the same thing is true in a professional bakery. A bakery has to be working at all levels, immediately, because if your ovens are SHOWSTOPPING PIES, PUDS & CAKES 208 .. l I \" on and not being used, you're wasting money. So you plan your time carefully. That's also true at home, when you want to be efficient as you bake, and make the most of your time. The bakers need two other qualities to do well: technique and artistic flair. Most have a bit of one aspect, and a lot of the other. Some might be talented and artistic, but have more style than substance. The skill is to marry the two together. When you get both, it's magical. The ones who do well in the competition tend to develop over time. And sometimes they're lucky, because another baker just happens to have done worse that day. The challenges we set for contestants show off and test their skills, and encourage people at home to bake. The Showstopper is the 'wow factor'. It's most often a highly decorated bake and this is where a baker's creativity shines through. What viewers get from this is ideas - how to create three-tiered cakes, how to make something look good. Some of the recipes in this chapter, such as the Swiss roll and the roulade, are more of a technical challenge that you can learn and then adapt to your own tastes. I've also given recipes for some of my favourite pies, a British tradition that we feature in the programme. Then there are the recipes that take technique to perfect, such as a mirror glaze on a cake. And there are some impressive pudding recipes, including souflles, that aren't that difficult to make once you've learnt a few tricks. People watching an elaborate cake being prepared may think, 'I don't think I could make that.' But there are also ways to make a bake special with the minimum amount of work and fuss. Part of this is flavour. But be careful - stick with flavours that you like and know work well together. There are lots of trendy and strange tastes out there. In reality you'll probably prefer coconut, banana, strawberry to Earl Grey or lavender. If you're dealing with flavours such as lavender, rosemary or rose then be sparing. Don't go crazy because the taste will kill everything. SHOWSTOPPING PIES, PUDS & CAKES 209 When I first started doing television, baking was seen as niche. But Bake Offhas had far more people watching it than any other cookery show. Sales ofbakeware, food mixers and different kinds of flours have soared and I can even see its impact in my day-to-day life. Everybody and anybody asks me about baking: 'My bread's too tight'; 'My cake's dropped in the middle'; 'How do I make a decent souffle?' The questions I get asked are many and varied. Builders shout out to me at the traffic lights- 'I burnt me cakes, mate, what am I doing wrong?' I get grandmas and kids coming up to me in supermarkets about their brownies. Why is this? It's because we're a nation ofbakers and we'd forgotten about that. We went through twenty years ofbuying stuff rather than making it. Now we've come back to making again. Some of the bakes in mainland Europe are complicated, but in this country we have some great basic bakes with good flavours. We've got a plethora of ingredients from all over the world to use. We've got some of the best flours. We've also got great bakers. No wonder people want to bake and learn more than ever before.

Take three bowls and tip the flour into one, lightly beat the eggs in another and place the breadcrumbs in the third. Divide the meat mixture into 4 equal portions. Lay a piece of cling film on your work surface, place a portion of the meat mixture on it and press down evenly to flatten. Take a boiled egg and dust with flour then sit on the flattened meat mixture. Bring the sides of the meat up around the egg, using the cling film to help wrap the egg; this also prevents the meat sticking to your hands. Dip the meat-wrapped egg in the beatE!n egg, then coat thoroughly in breadcrumbs. Dip in the egg and crumbs once more, giving it two coats for a crisper outside. Repeat with the other 3 boiled eggs. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. 1 Heat your oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Heat the oil into a deep-fryer or in a large, heavy saucepan, filling it is no more than one-third full. Heat theroil to 170°C, or until a cube ofbread dropped in turns brown in just over a minute. Deep-fry the eggs, two at a time, for 6-8 minutes until the outside is a deep golden brown colour, turning them over halfway through. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. To ensure the meat is cooked through, place the Scotch eggs on a baking tray in the oven for a further 8 minutes.

CHOCOLATE & SALTED CARAMEL MACARONS MAKES 30 It's a technical challenge to get perfect macarons but they'll taste good even. if they don't look immaculate. The key, as with so many bakes, is to be patient. Leave the piped macarons to rest so that a slight skin forms on the top. You then bake them off, pipe your filling on the base and sandwich them together. For the chocolate paste 3large eggwhites 240g ground almonds 240g icing sugar 40g cocoa powder For the meringue 3large egg whites 240g caster sugar 1 tbsp finely chopped cocoa nibs, to finish For the salted caramel filling 150g granulated sugar 90ml double cream Y. tsp fine sea salt 30g unsalted butter Line three baking trays with baking parchment. Using a 4.5cm cutter as a guide, draw circles on the paper, leaving 2cm space in between them. Turn the paper over and place on the baking tray (so you can see the circles but the lines won't mark the macarons ). To make the chocolate paste, put the egg whites into a bowl with the ground almonds, then sift over the icing sugar and cocoa powder. Mix together to form a thick paste. To make the meringue, put the egg whites and sugar into aheatproof bowl and set over a pan of simmering water (making sure the water is not touching the bowl). Using a balloon whisk, beat the mixture thoroughly until the sugar dissolves and the mixture reaches a temperature of 65°C (as registered on a cook's thermometer). . Remove the bowl from the heat. Either transfer the mixture to'a food mixer fitted with the whisk attachment or use a hand-held electric whisk to whisk until cooled and you have a stiff, glossy meringue; this will take at least 5 minutes. -~- ,- I\" . - Gradually fold the meringue into the chocolate paste, a spoonful at a time. The mixture is stiff so this will take some effort. Spoon the mixture into a piping bag fitted with a lcm nozzle, or snip the end off a paper piping bag to create an aperture of this size. Pipe the 'mixture evenly within the marked circles on the parchment. Sprinkle half of them with the chopped cocoa nibs. Leave the macarons to stand, uncovered, for at least 30 minutes, or until a skin forms. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 150°C/Gas 2. Bake the macarons for 15 minutes, until risen and set. Leave to cool completely on the baking trays before assembling. To make the caramel, place the sugar in a small heavy-based saucepan or frying pan. Over a low heat and without stirring, gently melt the sugar until it turns a golden caramel colour. AB soon as it has ch~ged colour, slowly pour in the cream and stir, protecting your hand with an oven glove as the mixture will bubble ferociously. Keep stirring until.the cream is incorporated, then add the salt and butter. Remove the pan from the heat and st~r vigorously with a woocten spoon until the butter has melted. Leave to cool in the pan. To assemble, transfer the caramel to a small paper piping bag and snip off the end. Pipe a little salted caramel onto the plain macaron bases, leaving a clear margin around the edge. Sandwich together with the cocoa-nib-topped macarons and place ofi a serving plate . MATCHA MIRROR GLAZE GATEAU SERVES 8 Matcha, a special Japanese powdered green tea, gives this sponge a modern flavour and brilliant colour; you can find it in health food shops. Once mastered, a mirror glaze turns a home-made cake into something beautiful. It's all about the shine and you have to be careful to get rid of all the crumbs, as every little bump will show. As the white chocolate glaze is very sweet, it is balanced with mascarpone cream between the layers, rather than a sweeter buttercream.", "labels": ["Recipe_Steps"]}, "id": "L67grNCd4a", "from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels"}, {"value": {"start": 256738, "end": 256809, "text": "----------------------~-.------------~----~--------~~----------------- ", "labels": ["Irrelevant"]}, "id": "ezfhraxyW3", "from_name": "label", "to_name": "text", "type": "labels"}, {"value": {"start": 256809, "end": 258682, "text": "For the Genoise sponge 125g plain flour 2 tbsp premium -grade matcha powder 4largeeggs 125g caster sugar 30gunsalted butter, melted For the filling 350g mascarpone 40ml double cream For the white chocolate mirror glaze 5g leaf gelatine (3 sheets Costa brand) 175g white chocolate (inexpensive Milky Bar works particularly well) 75mlwater 150g caster sugar lOOg condensed milk For the decoration A handful of raspberries lOg white chocolate, grated 1 tsp food -grade dried rose petals Small scrapes of gold leaf (optional) Heat your oven to 180°C/Gas 4.

Place the eggs and sugar in a large heatproofbowl and set over a pan ofbarely simmering water, making sure the bowl isn't touching the water. Using a hand-held electric whisk, beat until the mixture is pale, tripled in volume and thickened to a mousse-like consistency. This will take around 7-8 minutes. Remove the bowl from the heat and gently fold the flour mix into the whisked mixture, a couple of tablespoonfuls at a time, using a rubber spatula or a large metal spoon. Run the spatula (or spoon) around the outside of the mixture and then through the middle to incorporate the flour and keep in as much air as possible. Pour the melted butter around the side of the bowl and carefully fold in. Divide the mixture between the prepared cake tins and bake for 15-20 minutes, until risen and the cake springs back when lightly pressed with your fingertips. Leave to cool in the tins for 5 minutes then remove and transfer to a wire rack. Leave to cool completely. To make the filling, whisk the mascarpone and cream together in a bowl until thick.

Spread the remaining cream over the top and sides of the cake to cover it completely, then use a palette knife and plastic scraper to smooth the surfaces. Any imperfections will show up once the mirror glaze is applied so take your time over this - turn the cake around as you spread the cream with the edge of the palette knife or a scraper and wipe the blade with a clean, damp cloth to keep it free of crumbs. Place the cake in the fridge for 30 minutes to chill and firm up the cream. (You want the cream to be set firm but not too cold or the mirror glaze might crack.) To make the mirror glaze, soak the gelatine leaves in a shallow dish of cold water to soften for a few minutes. Chop the white chocolate into small pieces and place three-quarters in a medium bowl. Put the water, sugar and condensed milk in a saucepan and heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar has dissolved. Squeeze the excess water from the gelatine sheets then add them to the pan and immediately remove from the heat. Stir until the gelatine has dissolved. Pour the gelatine mixture onto the chocolate and whisk until the chocolate has melted. Add the remaining chocolate and stir to melt. Strain through a fine sieve into a jug (this helps to remove any air bubbles). Leave the glaze to cool until it is almost the consistency of condensed milk but still pourable (at about 25-27°C, but the exact temperature varies according to the brand of chocolate). To cool the mixture quickly, place the bowl in a larger bowl filled with iced water. Sit the cake on its board on a wire rack with a tray placed underneath. Carefully pour the glaze over the cake, starting at the outside edge so that it runs down over the sides and then pouring in a circular motion towards the middle.

These always include a bake. Birthdays mean birthday cake, with everyone sitting round and the candles to blow out. I've made many cakes for my lad Josh growing up. He likes chocolate cake and some years it is covered in his favourite sweets. I make sure the cake is good, make a lovely ganache and cover it in Milky Bars or whatever he wants. It's fine to go out and buy a novelty cake, but a cake made by family or friends is always best. Or take Easter. It makes me think of hot cross buns and Simnel cake. I love the marzipan on a Simnel cake, but in some ways it's the tradition of making that cake at that time which matters. Then there's Christmas cake. I like heavily fruited cakes with the crunch of royal icing, even though I'm full after dinner. The story of a wedding cake goes back hundreds of years. When Queen Victoria married Albert, they had a big tiered cake covered in white icing and that is when it became known as 'royal icing'. Such special cakes have always been about showing off skills and, most of all, sharing. If you can get people around a table with a bake central to that- a bread, a cake or pastries, it's a way of communicating, enjoying what you eat and share. Celebration cakes and bakes are often nostalgic because they are rooted in tradition and that's something we're very good at in this country. We have a long history ofbaking that has been passed down generation to generation. Every family has a go-to cake and with a bit of effort, even an everyday bake can be turned into something special- by decorating it and making it personal to you. If you know how to make a simple tea loaf, then you can make a round one and cover it with marzipan; decorate it with icing and put a bride and groom on the top and you'll have a straightforward wedding cake. CELEBRATIONS 252 One of the first cakes that most people ever make is a Victoria sandwich. Mix it together, bung it in a tin and bake it. I like to put cream in the filling- this goes against the rules for some, I know, but cream and cherry jam it is for me. I put the jam in first and pipe cream on top of the jam in concentric circles. I also like to put plenty of icing sugar on top of the cake. You can heat skewers over a gas flame and press them on to burn the icing sugar and make a criss-cross pattern. Or decorate the cake with a pile or rasp berries or cherries, the same flavour as the jam. All such ideas take the cake to another level. Decoration needn't be elaborate. You can make a simple ganache (using a decent amount of chocolate and cream and a little bit ofbutter), pour it on and leave it to set. Melt some white chocolate and spin that over, then fan some strawberries over the top to finish. You've gone from a £5 to a £25 cake, with the minimum of effort and outlay. Always remember that a cake at a celebration can be the main event or the finale at the end of the meal; it's often what you remember, so make it good. People can go overboard when it comes to decoration; I, for one, don't know when to stop. I love manipulating sugar paste. One year, I made a Christmas cake featuring mice in bed. The Christmas cake was the bed and the marzipan was the duvet and then I put sugar paste around the outside. There were twelve mice in the bed and I set the whole cake in a box, painting the walls with chocolate and making chocolate floorboards marked with toothpicks to get little knots. I put a sugar paste rug next to the bed and twelve pairs of slippers. Then I used sugar paste for Father Christmas's footprints to a fireplace, which I'd filled with chocolate sticks. I painted a picture of mice on the walls. There were stockings hanging on the bed post and toys spilling out from them onto the floor, all made with coloured sugar paste. By the time I'd finished, I'd set up a scene that wouldn't be out of place in Wallace and Gromit. CELEBRATIONS 253 Imagination is key. Take inspiration from things you like. If you can model something in Plasticine, you can do it in sugar paste. It's like sculpture- you just have to think in a three- dimensional way. There are lots of templates you can buy these days, or draw your own, copying or tracing over an image to help. I generally recommend baking a Madeira sponge for novelty cakes and large scale celebration cakes- so I've given a recipe in this chapter. It tastes good, is easy to cut and acts as a great base for other flavours and for your decorations. A whisked sponge would concertina down under even a slight amount of weight, but a Madeira will take icing, fruit, whatever you want. It's also important to use ingredients that will keep. Such cakes take time to make and you need to do them in advance of a big occasion, so use buttercream rather than fresh cream, for example. For big occasions, I have created two stunning celebration cakes. Royal icing has fallen from fashion, in terms ofhome baking, but I love this tradition and show you how to ice a cake in this way on pages 286-9, giving the tips of a professional. When you are piping, don't overfill the icing bag. Hold the bag at the top, rolling it down as you go so you don't get air bubbles. Keep the nozzle close to the cake, for more control, and don't push out the icing too fast- work smoothly and steadily. As well as a royal iced cake, I've given a recipe for a naked celebration cake, using a meringue-based icing that is scraped away to reveal part of the cake. The style is informal but the cake is modern and beautiful. The recipes in this chapter are for celebrations with family and friends, when we want to push the boat out. Some are more straightforward, and some are my personal take on classics such as creme brule e. Others, like the gingerbread house, take time. But, of course, you can simplify the decorations if you like; that applies to the other recipes in this chapter too. Whether you go to town or keep it simple, these bakes will lift a special occasion. CELEBRATIONS 255 ···v·· . -· - ----./ / .

Mix 250g of the royal icing sugar with 3 tbsp water to make a thick pipeable icing and put into a piping bag fitted with a writing nozzle. Pipe the decoration of your choice onto the walls. Pipe parallellines of icing on the roof and stick on the chocolate buttons, overlapping them slightly to resemble tiles. You can also pipe semi -circles of icing on each button for extra 'snow'. Leave the walls and roof to set for at least 10 hours, or overnight. To assemble the house, have your cake board ready. Heat the apricot jam with a little water, then brush over the cake board. Cover with the desiccated coconut so it looks like snow. Mix the remaining royal icing sugar and water to a thick paste. Pipe icing on the base and sides of the front wall. Use a mug as a prop and stand the front wall against it so that it remains upright and sticks to the cake board. Pipe icing along the sides and base of the other three walls.

Attach the front door with icing. Leave to set for at least 10 hours or overnight before attaching the roof, storing the spare icing in an airtight container. You can attach both roof pieces at once but it is easier to do this in two stages, leaving time for setting in between. Pipe a generous amount of icing on the top edge of one side wall and the front and back gable on the same side of the house. Use icing to attach a Flake to the top inside of that side wall to act as a support. Pipe icing on the edge of one roof piece and attach it to the house.

BASIC MADEIRA CAKE MAKES 40 - 60 SLICES (ONCE ICED) Madeira has more of a chew than a Victoria sandwich sponge and is the best cake to use as the basis for a celebration cake. Cakes for special occasions are often decorated beautifully but the cake inside can often be disappointing. This recipe delivers every time. When making large cakes it is much easier to use a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, if you have one. The following recipe is used to make the two tiered celebration cakes on the pages that follow. For the 15cm cake 165g self-raising flour llOg caster sugar llOg soft tub margarine, plus extra for greasing 2 medium eggs ltbspmilk For the 23cm cake 450g self-raising flour 400g caster sugar 400g soft tub margarine, plus extra for greasing 7 medium eggs 3tbspmilk Heat your oven to 150°C/ Gas 2. Grease the base and sides of a 15cm and a 23cm deep loose-based cake tin and line the base and sides ofboth tins with baking parchment. Put all the ingredients for the 15cm cake in a food mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and start mixing on the lowest speed to combine the ingredients. Then increase the speed and mix for about 1 minute until the mixture is smooth and pale in colour. Pour into the lined tin and smooth the top to level. Use the same method to prepare the larger cake. You can cook the cakes together, ideally on the same shelf in the centre of the oven. Allow about 1 hour for the smaller cake, about 1% hours for the larger cake; do not open the door to check the smaller cake before 55 minutes. The cakes should be risen, lightly golden and spring back when pressed gently. To test, insert a skewer into the centre of the cake: it should come out clean. If not, continue baking for a further 5-10 minutes. When each cake is ready, remove from the oven and leave to cool in the tin for 5 minutes, then turn out and place on a wire rack. Leave to cool completely.

(Using powdered instead ofliquid egg white gives the icing lightness.) Pour the egg white liquid into a food mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and add half the icing sugar. Mix on a slow speed to combine and then add the remaining icing sugar, a spoonful at a time, until you have the consistency of soft whipped cream.

FIVE DECADES OF BAKING - -·--- - --------, All my life, I have been surrounded by great baking. I've been in the industry for more than thirty years, and yet every day I learn something new. My childhood was in Merseyside and I grew up eating my mum's bakes at home- her ginger biscuits are legendary- and I was always in and out of my dad's bakeries. Following in his footsteps, I did an apprenticeship in high-street bakeries, then began working in five-star hotels. I moved to Cyprus in my late twenties, living and baking there for six years, as well as travelling around the Mediterranean and Middle East, learning about many different styles ofbread and pastry. Coming back to Britain, I set up my own bakeries and I also started to teach baking on television shows. Then one day I got a call asking me to audition as a presenter for a new programme: The Great British Bake Off So started a whole new chapter in my life. Through television, books and other forms of teaching, I'm proud to have been part of a revival of baking in Britain, and the celebration of one of our great national traditions. You don't have to go to college to make a career in baking. I learnt on the job; from reading and by watching other people, but most of all from doing. I've taught perhaps forty people how to bake professionally over the years, some of them from scratch. What matters most, whether amateur or professional, is hands- on experience and the ability and willingness to pick things up. What other qualities help? If you're making puff pastry, croissants, creme pat, bread or any number of other things, you need patience. And to be patient, you need passion. Because even if you fail, you'll do it again and again until you get it right; once you've got it right, you'll never forget. 8 The other key lesson is the importance of touch. Ifl go into a bakery, I can put my finger in a dough and tell you how that bread will come out of the oven- how it'll bake, how it'll look, what the crust is going to be like. That's purely the result of experience, which anyone can build up day by day. Get the knowledge in your fingertips. My dad always encouraged me to use my hands, and I've passed that on to everyone who's ever worked with me. Do something by hand, however much it seems like hard work, and you'll get to know the texture of what you're making. This goes for fillings and decoration too. A lot of people over-whip cream. If you use an electric whisk, you should always under-whip and then take it to the right consistency by hand, lifting the whisk up to see when it's ready. Cooks go by their own taste buds, altering recipes to suit their preferences- putting a little bit more in, tasting as they go. Baking is a different sort of skill. Bakers are scientific. You can play with the flavours in a bake but there's an underlying strategy and science. You have to do things precisely, weighing up the ingredients and getting the timing right. It's all about the chemistry, such as the rising agent's reaction to liquid, and how the salt and fat work with the flour and yeast. Fermentation is key - the way that a dough's flavour develops over time and how this is affected by the temperature of the air and water. Ingredients make a real difference too- the type ofbutter and the eggs used in a mixture and the way they emulsify. And then there's the importance of using your oven properly, taking care over any decoration and knowing the simple tricks that make a bake look great. There are two aspects to any bake: one is the base recipe; the other is flavour. Follow the base recipe to the letter initially- whether it's a Victoria sponge, Genoise, bread or croissant, don't change the recipe. When it comes to flavours, though, you can play around. You might think you need some more raspberries, 9 or cut them back, or change onions to mushrooms. But only do that after you've mastered the base recipe first and made it two or three times, so you have confidence in what you're doing. Ingredients do differ and you have to notice and respond to that as you bake. Different brands of flour may absorb up to five per cent more or less liquid. A good flour will absorb more liquid, which will give your bake more volume. Try the same recipe with different flours and you'll see the difference, and discover your own preferences. There's a plethora of equipment around these days to make baking easier. But in the end I prefer to use as little kit as possible. All you really need is a bread scraper, a good serrated knife and digital scales. A set of digital scales is the item of equipment that has really changed home baking, and is essential. I started with balance scales at work and they were fine for 20kg quantities, but when you're dealing in hundreds of grams digital precision makes a real difference. Bread scrapers are great for cutting dough and scraping it off surfaces, or smoothing icing on the top or sides of a cake. When you get one for the first time, you realise what you've been missing. I've used a Scotch scraper for forty years and I'll never be without one. A serrated knife is the most effective tool for cutting bakes. You can use it for cutting a sponge into discs, just as you do for slicing bread. Bakeware is much better than it used to be. It's worth buying good -quality trays and tins, as they'll last longer and won't warp. If you buy decent kit, the only thing you'll ever have to change is the battery in your digital scales. Baking teaches you patience and creativity, but more than that it teaches you what goes into your food. It helps you learn about ingredients and what they do in pastries, cakes and pies. It's also a family thing. Once a recipe is good, you can pass it on to 10 the rest of your family so they continue to make it. That's why it's very nostalgic -when people watch Bake Off and see a particular kind of cake, they think, 'My grandma used to make a cake like that and it was delicious,' then they want to make it themselves. Home baking and passing down these recipes has long been a tradition in Britain. We have always been good bakers in this country, but people sometimes forget that fact. I think people here are bakers before they are cooks. One reason is that cooking can be about sourcing special ingredients, whereas baking starts with the basics. Flour, sugar, salt and yeast are what we use- all raw ingredients that you have already in the cupboard. Anyone can bake, and you can start at any age. If you can get a few core bakes right - a Victoria sandwich, a favourite bread, a beautiful brioche, a buttery croissant- you will enter a whole new world of enjoyment, and save yourself money in the shops at the same time. Over the years, I've not only perfected my techniques and recipes, but also come to understand what it means to be a baker. The things I've learnt from decades as a professional are just as useful for the home baker who wants to make a weekend loaf, a batch ofbiscuits, a pie, a pud, a tart or a celebration cake. So this is what I'm sharing with you now- the recipes, lessons and experiences from my baker's life. A NOTE ON OVEN TEMPERATURE The baking times in m y recipes are for conventional ovens. If you are using a fan-assisted oven, you will need to lower the oven setting by around 1 0- 15°C. Ovens vary, so use an oven thermometer to verify the temperature and check your bakes towards the end of the suggested cooking time. 11 YOU ASSOCIATE YOUR childhood withfoodbecauseitmakes such an impact at the time. Sweet foods and other bakes are treats. They mean you've been good, or are having a good time. These are the moments that you find yourself remembering decades later. Baking is in my genes. My dad was a baker and when I was born in 1966 we lived in a flat above his shop. He would start work at 4am and the flat was permanently full of the smell ofbread. When my mum came down to gel the doughnuts she would hang me on a baby bouncer at the bottom of the stairs by the shop. I'd bounce away for hours, watching people bake. We moved to asemi-detachedhouse in Wallasey, in the Wirral, when I was very young and that's where I grew up. We were a very tight community where everyone knew each other and the kids all played outside in the street. My mum still lives in the same house, and she was born and raised in the next road. My mum hates cooking but she's creative- she worked as a graphic artist- and her pastry work and her biscuits were great. We were much involved in the church and that's where I saw a lot of cakes, bread and, predominantly, tray bakes. If someone had a birthday, we'd have a big bash or we'd go on an outing, perhaps to the seaside, and everyone would bring food to the table- my nan and mum included. Nowadays people are baking at home much more again but there was a gap of around twenty years when people just bought pre-made food. What I am part of now is a return to that ethos ofbakingyourself. On a Saturday, my mum used to make a fruit pie for Sunday lunch, all from scratch. The fruit- rhubarb, apples or pears- was always home-grown. I would climb the apple tree in our garden with my two younger brothers, Jason and Lee, partly to pick apples and partly to get onto the shed roof to be naughty and throw stones. NOSTALGIC BAKES 14 I t I ~ Saturday was a fun day; there was no school and my dad was off work so I'd get to see him. In the afternoon, he'd bake bread rolls, making dough in a bowl, shaping the buns and putting them on a tray to rise in front of a gas fire with a damp cloth over the top. I remember lifting the cloth to have a quick look. They were growing. Then he baked them off, and they were absolutely delicious. I would recognise that flavour anywhere; it's the taste of something home-made. My dad was a baker who knew his stuff, and he understood that the longer you rise a bread before you knock it back and let the shaped loaf prove (grow again), the greater the flavour. It's down to fermentation- one of the most important lessons for any baker. While the rolls were proving, I remember Dad sitting down and watching the wrestling on a Saturday- invariably Big Daddy was up against Giant Haystacks- and we'd be there, me and my two brothers. Then we would watch a bit of the Generation Game, a TV game show where novices tried to copy a skill demonstrated by a professional. At the age of six, I remember seeing a guy plaiting bread and being fascinated. Thirty-odd years later, I went on the Generation Game myself and plaited bread, just like that baker. My nans- Olive and Amy -lived in fiats above shops in big Victorian houses and they each had a minute kitchen and a pantry. The smell ofbaking always struck me in my dad's mum's house. She ran a launderette until she was eighty. Tough as old boots. She used to say to me, 'Your dad's the best baker in the country. He works all the hours God sends.' So I grew up with this sense of good baking. Both sides of the family were grafters. My great-great-great grandfather on Mum's side used to run across Scotland and back in a week, delivering and collecting the post for his community on the west coast. It was the equivalent of about twenty-one marathons a month. I didn't know that when I was growing up, NOSTALGIC BAKES 15 - I l but I had a lot of energy as a child- in double-games I would opt to run round and round a field without stopping- and later on, I regularly did thirteen- or fourteen-hour shifts as a baker. My dad built up achainofbakeries in the Northeast and as a child and teenager I'd go along with him to help out or watch the lads work. There was a very old stainless steel machine that was used to pierce each doughnut, then you'd pull two levers to inject the perfect amount of jam. Sometimes I'd do it with my brother and we'd go ge-dung, ge-dung, ge-dung, putting more and more jam in until the doughnuts became like jam bombs. My dad's bakeries were all open plan. In the front, there was the shop area displaying all the cakes and cream cakes, the steak and kidney pies, the sausage rolls and the bread on racks. Then you would swing round to a patisserie area with rum truffles and little brownies. I used to disappear off and talk to the people in the shop, to ask ifl could take a cream doughnut. It would seem almost as big as my head but I'd eat the lot. My dad would go mad, saying, 'Why's he doing that- he won't eat his dinner!' I had no idea that I wanted to be a baker back then. At the time I was just fascinated by baking and everything that went with it -the white aprons hanging on washing lines with Dad's checks, white t-shirts and long white coats. Ifl hugged my dad when he came back from work, he always had that smell ofbread. Years later, I remember coming home from my bakery and my lad Joshua saying to me: 'Dad, you smell like a loaf!' NOSTALGIC BAKES 17 MY MUM'S GINGER BISCUITS MAKES 25 - 30 Mum used to make these easy biscuits several times a week. Not only are they a doddle to make but they've got the right balance ofbeing crispy and chewy. You can use butter instead of margarine if you like; they taste great either way. ------------------------~------------------~~--*M~~--~--------~.----- llOg margarine llOg caster sugar llOg golden syrup 225g self-raising flour, plus extra for dusting 2 tsp ground ginger Heat your oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Line two large baking trays with baking parchment. Melt the margarine, caster sugar and golden syrup together gently in a saucepan over a medium heat. Once melted, remove from the heat and let cool slightly. Add all of the dry ingredients to the pan and stir to combine and make a smooth dough. Once the dough is cool enough to handle, use lightly floured hands to roll into balls, each the size of a 50p piece. Place them on the baking trays, leaving enough room in between to allow them to spread during cooking. Mark the top of each ball with a fork. Put the baking trays into the oven and bake for about 10-12 minutes, or until the biscuits are golden brown. Remove from the oven and leave to cool and firm up slightly on the tray, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. NOSTALGIC BAKES 19 MILLIONAIRE'S SHORTBREAD WITH SALTED CARAMEL MAKES ABOUT 12 BARS What is there not to like about a caramel chocolate biscuit? I've tried some good shop-bought millionaire's shortbread but it's even better if you make it yourself, as you can choose the chocolate and cut it into the size of pieces you want. I've updated this childhood favourite by adding salt to the caramel and a topping of macadamia nuts. This version is a great For the base 150g unsalted butter, softened 75g caster sugar 175g plain flour A pinch of fine salt 25g fine semolina or ground rice For the salted caramel filling 120g condensed milk 60g golden syrup 150gunsalted butter 150g soft light brown sugar 1 tsp sea salt flakes For the topping favourite of my son Josh. Heat your oven to 150°C/ Gas 2. Line a shallow 27 x 18cm baking tin with baking parchment. To make the base, in a bowl, cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the flour, salt and semolina or ground rice and mix with a spoon and then your hands to form a smooth dough; try not to overwork it. Press the mixture into the prepared tin and prick the surface all over with a fork. Bake for 35-40 minutes until pale but cooked through. For the salted caramel filling, weigh all the ingredients except the salt into a pan. Melt over a medium heat, stirring occasionally, and then bring to the boil. As it boils, keep stirring- the caramel bubbles will become larger and the mixture will thicken and turn a rich, glossy caramel colour. 200g dark chocolate (I use Pour the caramel evenly over the shortbread, sprinkle on the sea salt chocolate with 40% cocoa flakes and leave to cool and set. solids, like Bourneville), cut into small pieces For the topping, melt the chocolate in a heatproofbowl suspended 50g macadamia nuts, over a pan of simmering water, making sure the bottom of the bowl roughly chopped doesn't touch the water. Pour the melted chocolate over the caramel layer so it is completely covered, spread to level and smooth the surface with a palette knife. Scatter over the macadamia nuts. Leave to set completely, then cut into bars. NOSTALGIC BAKES 20 JAM TARTS MAKES 15 - 20 My mum used to make these for us when we were little, often using leftover pastry from a pie. She'd dollop brightly coloured Robinson's strawberry or raspberry jam into the pastry cases. Her tip is to not fill them too much or the jam can gurgle over and make a mess. Jam tarts are simple to make but we love them and they're worth rediscovering for family teas or children's parties. 170g self-raising flour, plus extra for dusting 85gcold unsalted butter or margarine, cut into small dice 1-3 tbsp cold water About15 tsp jam (any flavour) They are very basic, very cheap- and a treat. Heat your oven to 200°C/Gas 6 and have ready two shallow 12-hole bun trays. Put the flour into a bowl, add the butter or margarine and rub in with your fingers until the mixture resembles bread crumbs. Stir in just enough water to bring it together to form a dough. Roll out the pastry dough on a lightly floured work surface to a 4mm thickness. Using a 6.5- 7cm fluted pastry cutter, cut out 15-20 circles. Use the pastry rounds to line the bun trays (you'll probably have some spare hollows). Add a scant teaspoonful of jam to each pastry case -not too much or it will ooze everywhere. Re-roll the leftover pastry to make more tarts or use a star cutter to cut lids and position on top of the jam filling. Bake in the oven for about 25-30 minutes, until the pastry is pale brown, checking after 20 minutes. Leave the tarts to cool in the trays for 5 minutes, then carefully remove and place on a wire rack. Leave to cool completely. NOSTALGIC BAKES 23 STICKY GINGER TRAY BAKE MAKES 15 SLICES The beauty of a tray bake is that it's easy to transport in the tin you bake it in and then cut into portions to share out. Ginger is a simple way of flavouring a sponge and stem ginger adds a little texture, as well as a fresh and fragrant kick. The ginger syrup soaks into the sponge and makes it shine on top. ------·----------------·-~------------~-.--~·--~~--,~·--·~·~---------------- 220g unsalted butter, softened 220g soft dark brown sugar 3large eggs, beaten 220g self-raising flour 1 tbsp ground ginger 4 knobs of stem ginger, chopped into small pieces 2 tbsp stem ginger syrup For the ginger syrup 60g soft dark brown sugar lOOmlwater Y2 tsp ground ginger Heat your oven to 180°C/ Gas 4. Line a 30 x 20cm baking tin with baking parchment. In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the beaten eggs a little at a time, beating well to incorporate each addition. Sift the flour and ground ginger together over the mixture and gently fold in. Finally, fold in the chopped stem ginger and syrup. Pour the mixture into the prepared tin and gently level the surface. Bake for 25- 30 minutes, until risen and springy to the touch. Leave to cool slightly. For the syrup, gently heat the sugar, water and ground ginger together in a small pan until the sugar is dissolved. Bring to the boil and let the syrup bubble away until it thickens a little. While the tray bake is still warm, make small holes all over the surface with a skewer then pour on the syrup, so it seeps into the holes. Leave to cool completely. Cut into pieces to serve. NOSTALGIC BAKES 24 ,- -- ORANGE & WALNUT TRAY BAKE MAKES 15 SLICES Here's a tray bake based on an afternoon cake I love, walnut with orange instead of the more usual coffee and walnut. The softness of the sponge, the walnuts and the intense flavour from the citrus fruit make it delicious withacupoftea. 220gunsalted butter, softened 220g caster sugar 3large eggs, beaten Finely grated zest of Yz orange plus 2 tbsp juice 1 tsp orange extract 220g self-raising flour 100g chopped walnuts For the topping 60g unsalted butter, softened 250g full-fat cream cheese 200g icing sugar, plus extra for dusting Finely grated zest of 1orange 1 tsp orange extract 60g walnut halves Heat your oven to 180°C/ Gas 4. Line a 30 x 20cm baking tin with baking parchment. In a large bowl, cream together the butter and sugar, until light and fluffy. Gradually add the beaten eggs, beating well after each addition. Add the orange zest, juice and extract and stir to incorporate. Gently fold in the flour and chopped walnuts. Tip the mixture into the prepared tin and gently level the surface. Bake for 25-30 minutes, until risen and springy to the touch. Leave to cool slightly in the tin before removing and transferring to a wire rack. Leave to cool completely. For the topping, beat the butter, cream cheese and icing sugar together until smooth, then beat in the orange zest and extract. Spread the icing over the top of the tray bake with a palette knife or the back of a large spoon and decorate with the walnut halves. Cut into pieces to serve. NOSTALGIC BAKES 27 COCONUT TRAY BAKE MAKES 12-15 SLICES There's something very British about a tray bake. This one has pretty pink icing dusted with desiccated coconut and was considered a favourite back in the seventies. Coconut is a tropical ingredient but it's along-standingpart of British baking, both as a flavouring and as a decoration- think of the Snowball and coconut macaroons. You can even serve this tray bake as a dessert, with plenty of custard- a popular school-dinner pud. 200gunsalted butter, softened 200g caster sugar 3large eggs, beaten 1 tsp vanilla extract 200g self-raising flour lOOg desiccated coconut 2-3 tbsp milk For the topping 150g icing sugar 1-2 tbsp cold water A few drops of pink food colouring 40g desiccated coconut ;, Heat your oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Line a 30 x 20cm baking tin with baking parchment. In a large bowl, cream the butter and sugartogetheruntillight and fluffy. Gradually add the beaten eggs, beating well after each addition, then stir in the vanilla extract. Add the flour and desiccated coconut and gently fold in. Finally add enough milk to achieve a loose enough consistency for the mixture to drop easily off a spoon. Pour the mixture into the prepared tin and gently level the surface. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until risen and springy to the touch. Allow to cool slightly in the tin, then remove and place on a wire rack. Leave to cool completely. To make the topping, sift the icing sugar into a bowl and add 2 tsp water with a few drops of pink colouring. Mix until smooth, then add more water, 1 tsp at a time, until you have a smooth, spreadable icing. Pour the icing onto the centre of the coconut cake and use a palette knife to spread it out to the edges. While the icing is still wet, sprinkle over the desiccated coconut. Leave to set before cutting into pieces. CHOCOLATE TEA CAKES MAKES 12 As a kid I loved Tunnock's Tea Cakes and I'm still partial to them now. There's that great moment when you bite through the crispy shell, hit that marshmallow and then the biscuit underneath. These are fun to make, too. ------·-------------=\"-\"-~--------------~--~--~·DM------~~~--- For the biscuit bases 200gplain flour, plus extra for dusting Y. tsp baking powder A pinch of fine salt 50g cold unsalted butter, cut into small dice 50g caster sugar 2-3 tbsp milk For the filling 3large egg whites 150g caster sugar 2 tbsp glucose syrup For the topping 300g dark chocolate (I use chocolate with 40% cocoa solids, like Bourneville), cut into small pieces For the biscuit bases, line two baking trays with baking parchment. Sift the flour, baking powder and salt together into a bowl. Add the butter and rub in using your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Stir in the sugar. Incorporate enough milk to bring the mixture together to form a ball. On a lightly floured surface roll out the dough to a 5mm thickness and stamp out 12 discs using a 7cm plain cutter. Place on the prepared trays. Chill for at least 30 minutes. Heat your oven to 170°C/Gas 3 Y:z. Bake the chilled dough discs for 12-15 minutes until lightly browned. Transfer the biscuits to a wire rack to cool and firm up. For the filling, put all the ingredients into a large heatproofbowl set over a pan ofhot (but not boiling) water, making sure the bottom of the bowl doesn't touch the water. Using a hand-held electric whisk, beat for about 8 minutes until you have a stiff, smooth and silky meringue mixture (the aim is to gently melt the sugar as you whisk). Spoon the mixture into a piping bag fitted with a medium plain nozzle and pipe a mound on each cooled biscuit base, leaving a small margin around the edge. Place the biscuits on a wire rack over a sheet of baking parchment. For the topping, melt 200g chocolate in a bowl over a pan ofhot water, making sure the bowl is not touching the water. Remove from the heat and add the rest of the chocolate so that it melts. Leave to cool slightly; it must not be too hot or it will melt the meringue. Spoon the chocolate onto the tea cakes to coat completely, allowing the excess to fall onto the parchment below, and smooth with a palette knife. If the chocolate gets too cool, put the bowl back over the pan ofhot water briefly. You can also re-melt the chocolate that has fallen onto the parchment. Allow the chocolate to set before serving. Photographs overleaf NOSTALGIC BAKES 30 ' (' CHOCOLATE CORN FLAKE CAKES MAKES 12 A staple at kids' parties! these are just as popular now as they were in the sixties and seventies when I was growing up. A great first recipe to introduce children to baking, there are only three ingredients and it gets them into stirring well to ensure all the cornflakes are coated. Of course, the best bit is licking the bowl when you've finished. ----------~ .. '1'11 ISS .......,......,., __________ ..,.,___....,. _________ _ 40gunsalted butter 125g dark chocolate (I use chocolate with 40% cocoa solids, like Bourneville), cut into small pieces 75g cornflakes Line a 12-hole bun tray with paper cupcake cases. Put the butter and chocolate into a large pan and gently melt together over a low-medium heat, stirring until combined and smooth. Remove the pan from the heat and add half the cornflakes. Stir until these are coated in chocolate, then add the remaining cornflakes and stir until they are all coated in chocolate. Divide the mixture between the paper cases and leave to cool and set before eating. NOSTALGIC BAKES 34 MARSHMALLOW CRISPY RICE BARS MAKES 9 LARGE OR 12 MEDIUM BARS When my mum used to make these, we'd never leave the mixture to set. By the time she'd tipped it into the tin, we'd be spooning it up. Leave it be until firm ... if you can. You can cut it into as many pieces as you like. The mixture is very sweet so some will prefer just a small nugget, others a large bar. 50g unsalted butter 2 tbsp golden syrup 200g marshmallows 125g crispy rice cereal 20g mini marshmallows, to finish Line the base and sides of a 20cm square tin with baking parchment. Put the butter, golden syrup and the 200g marshmallows into a large saucepan and heat gently until melted, stirring constantly to combine and prevent the mixture sticking. Remove the pan from the heat, add the rice cereal and mix until well coated in the marshmallow mix. Transfer the mixture to the prepared tin. As it is very sticky, cover the surface with a sheet ofbaking parchment and then press down well to level the surface. Remove the parchment and gently but firmly press down onto the mixture with the back of a large metal spoon. Scatter mini marshmallows over the surface and leave to cool, then cut into squares and remove from the tin. NOSTALGIC BAKES 36 TEA LOAF MAKES 1 LARGE TEA LOAF When I started baking, ingredients and kitchen kit used imperial measurements. Nowadays, everything is metric but many bakers and recipes still refer to loaf tins in pounds. This tea loaf is always baked in a 2lb tin (that's 900gin metric), with dimensions of roughly 23 x 13 x 7cm. --------------------------·----------------~-------~--~--------------- 150gsultanas 150g raisins 150gcurrants 150m! strong hot black tea 225g self-raising flour 175g demerara sugar !large egg, beaten 3-4 tbsp milk Put the dried fruit into a bowl, pour over the hot tea and stir well, then cover with cling film and leave to soak overnight. The next day, heat your oven to 160°C/ Gas 3. Line a 900g (2lb) loaf tin with baking parchment. Drain the soaked fruit and place in a large bowl. Add the flour, sugar, beaten egg and enough milk to give a dropping consistency, mixing well to combine. Spoon the mixture into the prepared loaf tin and level the surface with the back of a spoon. Bake for about 1 hour, or until a skewer inserted into the centre comes out clean. Leave the loaf to cool in the tin for 5 minutes, then remove and place on a wire rack to finish cooling. Slice, spread with butter and enjoy. NOSTALGIC BAKES 39 SALLY LUNN MAKES 1 LOAF The bakeries in theN orthwest have a certain style. In other parts of the country, a Sally Lunn refers to a round tea bread or smaller buns. For us, it is a large, oval-shaped fruited bun, covered in icing, but made with the same enriched buttery dough, studded with dried fruit. It's best eaten freshly made. --------------------------·~--------------------~~------------------ 450g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting 3 tbsp caster sugar 7g instant dried yeast 7gfinesalt 40g unsalted butter, cut into small pieces, softened, plus extra for greasing 125ml whole milk About 125ml cold water 75g mixed dried fruit Finely grated zest ofl orange Finely grated zest ofllemon 1 tsp ground cinnamon 50g glace cherries, chopped For the icing 200g icing sugar 20-30ml water Put the flour and sugar into a large bowl. Add the yeast to one side of the bowl and the saltto the other. Add the butter, milk and three- quarters of the water. Using the fingers of one hand, mix everything together. Add the remaining water, a little at a time, until all the flour is incorporated- you want a soft but not soggy dough. (You may not need all the water or you may need a bit more; it depends on the flour.) Tip onto a lightly floured surface and knead for 5-10 minutes until you have a soft, smooth dough. Place in a lightly greased bowl, cover with a tea towel and leave to rise for 1-3 hours, until doubled in size. Meanwhile, mix the dried fruit with the citrus zests, cinnamon and glace cherries. Line a large baking tray with baking parchment. Tip the risen dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knock back by folding it inwards repeatedly until all the air is knocked out. Shape into a large rectangle and scatter the fruit mix over the surface. Fold the dough over to encase the fruit, then knead to distribute it evenly. Dust the work surface with more flour and roll out the dough to a large rectangle, with a long side facing you. Fold each end into the middle, then roll up and turn over so the join is underneath. Roll the dough lightly, applying more pressure at the ends to create a long oval shape. Lift the loaf onto the prepared baking tray and place in a large, clean plastic bag. Leave to prove for about an hour, until doubled in size. Heat your oven to 190°0/Gas 5. Take the baking tray out of the plastic bag and place in the oven. Bake for 30-35 minutes until the loaf is risen and golden brown. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. For the icing, sift the icing sugar into a bowl and mix in enough water to make a thick but spreadable icing that coats the back of a spoon. Spread the icing evenly over the top of the cooled loaf and leave to set. Slice and serve with butter for spreading. NOSTALGIC BAKES 40 CUSTARD TART SERVES 8 As a lad, !found custard tarts from the bakery irresistible: a hand-held treat in a foil cup. Here is my recipe for a family-sized version, which makes a lovely pud. Don't stint on the nutmeg- this fragrant spice gives the tart its character. --------------------~·--~·-----~~--~~-------.. ---*\"------~--.~--------------.__..__ For the pastry 200gplain flour, plus extra for dusting 2 tbsp icing sugar lOOg cold unsalted butter, cut into small dice 1 medium egg, beaten Y, tsp lemon juice 2-3 tsp very cold water For the custard filling 250ml whole milk 350ml double cream 8 medium egg yolks BOg caster sugar Y. -Y. whole nutmeg For the pastry, mix the flour and icing sugar together in a bowl. Add the butter and rub in until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Make a well in the centre. In a jug, lightly whisk the egg with the lemon juice and 2 tsp cold water, then pour into the well. Mix into the flour, using one hand to bring the pastry together and adding a splash more water if needed. As the dough comes together, gently knead into a ball. Wrap in cling film and rest in the fridge for at least 30 minutes. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and roll out to a circle, about 3mm thick and large enough to line a 20cm loose-based tart tin. Lift the pastry into the tin and press into the edges, leaving the excess hanging over the top. Prick the base all over with a fork, then chill in the fridge for 15 minutes. Heat your oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Line the pastry case with a sheet of baking parchment and fill with baking beans. Bake 'blind' for 12-15 minutes, or until the pastry is dry to the touch and golden around the edge. Remove the beans and parchment and bake for a further 5-8 minutes, until the pastry case is crisp and light golden brown all over. Let cool, then use a small, sharp knife to trim away the excess pastry from the edge. Turn the oven down to 150°C/Gas 2. For the filling, pour the milk and cream into a pan and slowly bring to the boil. Meanwhile, whisk the egg yolks and sugar together in a bowl, then pour on the hot, creamy milk, stirring as you do so. Strain through a sieve into a jug and allow to settle for a few minutes. Pour the custard into the tart case, then finely grate the nutmeg over the surface until it is completely covered. Bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the custard is just set. Place the tart in its tin on a wire rack to cool; the custard will firm up as it cools down. You can keep this tart, covered, in the fridge, for a day or two but bring it back to room temperature before serving. NOSTALGIC BAKES 43 ,--------------- --------------------------- TRIFLE SERVES 6 To this day, no one makes trifle as good as my mum. She doesn't include any sherry in her recipe and that's how I like it- with no booze,just simple home-made sponge, fruit jelly, custard and cream. Forthen;flesponge 4 medium eggs, separated 125g caster sugar 125g plain flour Y. tsp baking powder 1 tbsp granulated sugar, for sprinkling For the custard 300rnl whole milk 300rnl double cream 1 vanilla pod, split lengthways 4large egg yolks 3 tbsp cornflour 2 tbsp caster sugar Forthefruitjelly 2 x 135g packets strawberry jelly, broken into cubes 300rnl boiling water 500rnl cold water 400g strawberries, hulled and halved For the topping 600rnl whipping cream 1 chocolate Flake bar -~----------·---·-----~·----~·-M~~~·-n---------------- For the trifle sponge, heat your oven to 190°C/Gas 5 and line a baking tin, about 20 x 27cm, with baking parchment. In a large bowl, whisk the egg yolks with 50g of the caster sugar until the mixture is smooth, thickened and paler in colour. In another, clean bowl, whisk the egg whites until stiff, then gradually add the remaining caster sugar, whisking well between each addition, to make a smooth, glossy meringue. Gently fold the meringue into the egg yolk mixture, a spoonful at a time, until it is all incorporated. Sift the flour and baking powder together over the mixture then fold in carefully, using a spatula, until evenly combined. Pour into the prepared tin and sprinkle the granulated sugar over the surface. Bake for 20 minutes, then lower the oven setting to 150°C/Gas 2 and bake for another 20 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. To make the custard, pour the milk and cream into a pan. Scrape in the seeds from the vanilla pod and add the empty pod. Heat gently until the milk is almost boiling. Meanwhile, beat the egg yolks, cornflour and sugar together in a bowl. Discard the vanilla pod, then slowly pour the hot creamy milk onto the beaten mixture, whisking as you do so. Pour back into the pan and stir over a low heat until the custard thickens. Take off the heat and cover the surface with cling film to prevent a skin forming. Put the jelly cubes into a heatproofbowl, pour on the boiling water and stir until the cubes melt. Add the 500ml cold water and stir. Cut the sponge into squares and layer in the base of a serving bowl (about 25cm diameter and lOcm deep). Scatter over the strawberry halves, then cover with the jelly and refrigerate until set. Pour the custard over the jelly and chill to set again. When ready to serve, whip the cream until thick and spread over the custard layer. Crumble the chocolate Flake over the surface to finish. NOSTALGIC BAKES 44 NO-BAKE CHEESECAKE SERVES 6 There are different kinds of cheesecake and the no-bake version is the one from my childhood. The key is to have the right amount of gelatine to make it firm enough to slice but still gently creamy. Decorate the top as you like. --------------------·-----~------~----------~··---~--------------- For the base lOOgunsalted butter, melted, plus extra for greasing 150g digestive biscuits For the filling 6.5g leaf gelatine (about 4 sheets Costa brand) 325g full-fat cream cheese 2 tbsp caster sugar 1 tsp vanilla extract 175ml double cream 60mljust-boiled water For the topping 4g leaf gelatine (about 2 Y. sheets Costa brand) 150ml red berry juice (any flavour- it's the colour that matters) 150g fresh or defrosted frozen summer berries Grease a 20cm loose-based cake tin with butter. For the base, put the digestive biscuits into a strong plastic bag and bash with a rolling pin to a crumb-like texture. Tip into a bowl, add the melted butter and stir until all the crumbs are coated. Spoon into the prepared tin, press down firmly onto the base and chill until set firm. For the filling, put the gelatine leaves into a heatproofbowl, cover with cold water and set aside to soften. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, mix the cream cheese with the caster sugar and vanilla extract, beating until smooth. In another bowl, whip the cream to soft peaks and then fold into the cream cheese mixture. Lift the gelatine leaves out of their bowl and squeeze to remove any excess water. Pour away the water then put the gelatine back into the bowl. Immediately pour on the 60mljust-boiled water and stir until the gelatine has dissolved, then fold into the cream cheese mixture until well combined. Pour the filling mixture onto the chilled biscuit base. Smooth and level the surface, using a small, angled palette knife or the back of a large spoon. Place in the fridge to set. For the topping, put the gelatine leaves into a small heatproofbowl, cover with cold water and leave to soften. Heat the berry juice in a pan but do not let it boil. Squeeze the gelatine to remove any excess water and discard the water in the bowl. Put the gelatine back into the bowl, pour over the hot berry juice and stir to dissolve. Leave the liquid to cool until slightly thickened but still pourable. Pour the thickened berry juice over the top of the set cheesecake and arrange the berries on top. Place in the fridge until set. Carefully remove the cheesecake from the tin and transfer to a fiat serving plate shortly before serving. NOSTALGIC BAKES 46 APPLE PIE SERVES 6 My mum's fruit pies were really good. She'd put sugar on the top before baking and add a little bit more after, to create the sugar crumb coating- delicious. The Bramleys came from our garden. She liked to serve the pie warm with Bird's custard, never cream. My tip is to sprinkle custard powder onto the base of the pastry case: this avoids a soggy bottom by soaking up some of the juices; it also gives a hint of subtle custard flavour to the filling. ----------------------~·~·----·--------~--~--~--------~~~·~---------------- For the pastry 275g plain flour, plus extra for dusting 2 tbsp icing sugar 140g cold butter, cut into small dice 3- 4 tbsp cold water For the filling 3large Brarnleys or other cooking apples 4 tbsp caster sugar 3tbspwater 2 tbsp custard powder For the glaze !medium egg, beaten 3 tsp caster sugar, for dusting For the pastry, mix the flour and icing sugar together in a bowl. Add the butter and rub in until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Using one hand, mix in just enough water to bring the pastry together and gently knead into a ball. Wrap in cling film and place in the fridge to rest while you make the filling. Peel and core the apples, then cut into slices, about 4cm long and 5mm thick. Tip into a saucepan and add the caster sugar and water. Cook over a medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the apples soften but still hold their shape. Leave to cool. Heat your oven to 200°C/ Gas 6 and have a 24cm pie plate ready. Divide the pastry into 2 pieces, roughly two-thirds and one-third. Lightly flour your work surface and roll out the larger piece of pastry to a 2-3mm thickness. Use this to line the base of the pie plate. Roll out the remaining pastry to form the lid for the pie and set aside. Sprinkle the custard powder over the pastry base and spoon the cooled apple filling on top. Brush the pastry edges with some of the beaten egg, then lift the pastry lid on top. Press the pastry edges together and crimp with a fork or pinch between your thumb and finger, then trim away any excess. Use the pastry trimmings to make leaves or other decorations, sticking them on top of the pie with a little beaten egg. Brush the top of the pie with beaten egg then sprinkle with 2 tsp of the caster sugar to glaze. Make 2 or 3 small slits in the top to let the steam out. Bake for 30-35 minutes, until the pastry is golden brown. Sprinkle an extra 1 tsp sugar over the surface. Leave the pie to rest for 15 minutes before serving. Enjoy with ice cream, cream or custard. NOSTALGIC BAKES 48 CREAMY MUSHROOM VOL-AU-VENTS MAKES 8 Vol-au-vents of various types often appeared at family gatherings when I was growing up. I liked a mushroom filling and remember using tinned mushroom soup as the base for a slightly dubious batch when I was at art school. This is a more refined version, with tasty dried porcini mushrooms and tarragon adding another layer of flavour to the button mushrooms. 500g block of ready-made all-butter puff pastry Plain flour, for dusting 1 medium egg, beaten, to glaze For the filling lOg dried porcini mushrooms, finely chopped 150mljust-boiled water 40gunsalted butter lOOgbaby button mushrooms, wiped and halved or quartered 20g plain flour 75ml double cream 1 tbsp finely chopped tarragon Salt and black pepper Line a large baking tray with baking parchment. Cutthe puff pastry block in half. Roll out one half on a lightly floured surface to a 5mm thickness and use a 6.5cm fluted cutter to stamp out 8 rounds. Use a 3.5cm plain cutter to cut out the middles from these. The little rounds will form the vol-au-vent tops, while the rings will become the sides. Roll out the other portion of puff pastry to a 3mm thickness and cut out 8 bases using the 6.5cm fluted cutter. Place the vol-au-vent bases and little tops on the prepared baking tray. Prick the bases with a fork, then brush the edge of each base with beaten egg and stick a pastry ring on top. Brush the surface of the rings and the little tops with beaten egg. Place in the fridge for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 200°C/ Gas 6. Bake the vol-au -vent cases for 15-20 minutes until risen, crisp and golden. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. To make the filling, put the dried porcini in a small heatproofbowl, add the boiled water and leave to soak for at least 30 minutes. Heat 20g of the butter in a frying pan until melted and foaming then add the button mushrooms. Cook on a high heat until starting to turn golden. Season with salt and pepper then remove from the pan and set aside. Melt the remaining 20g butter in the pan, then stir in the flour. Add a little of the soaked porcini with some of the liquor, stirring as it comes to the boil. Continue to slowly add the porcini and liquor until you have a smooth, thick sauce. Stir in the button mushrooms and cream. Taste to check the seasoning and add the chopped tarragon. Fill the cooked vol-au-vent cases with the mushroom mixture, top with the pastry lids and serve. NOSTALGIC BAKES 51 NAN'S MINCE & ONION PLATE PIE SERVES 4 - 6 As a kid I loved my nan's mince, onion and potatoes. That's all it was- minced beef, onion and potato, but boy did it taste good. This is the original recipe, which has been turned into a simple plate pie that nan would approve of. I love the crispness, flavour and gloss you get from the lard in the pastry. (I've used the same filling to create the posh puff pastry pithivier on page 55.) For the pastry 300g plain flour, plus extra for dusting A pinch of fine salt 80g cold unsalted butter, cut into small dice 70g cold lard, cut into small dice 4-6 tbsp cold water 1 medium egg, beaten, to glaze For the mince and onionfiUing 1 tbsp sunflower or vegetable oil 400gbeefmince 1 onion, chopped 1 tbsp plain flour 1large potato, peeled and cut into bite-sized dice 300mlwater 1 beef stock cube Salt and white pepper First make the filling. Heat the oil in a wide pan over a high heat. When hot, add the mince and onion and cook until the meat begins to brown, stirring from time to time to separate any lumps of meat. Lower the heat, add the flour and cook, stirring, for 2-3 minutes. Add the potato and water, then crumble in the stock cube. Season with salt (allowing for the saltiness of the stock cube) and pepper. Bring to the boil, then cover, lower the heat and simmer for 20-25 minutes until the gravy thickens and the potatoes are cooked through. Taste and add more salt and/or pepper if needed. Allow to cool, then chill. To make the pastry, put the flour and salt into a bowl. Add the butter and lard and rub in using your fingertips until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add just enough cold water to bring the dough together. Form into a ball, wrap in cling film and rest in the fridge for 30 minutes. Heat your oven to 200°0/Gas 6. Have ready a 23cm metal pie plate. Divide the pastry into two pieces, roughly two-thirds and one-third. Lightly dust your work surface with flour and roll out the smaller piece into a circle, about 3mm thick and slightly larger than your pie plate. Line the pie plate with this piece of pastry. Roll out the remaining pastry to a larger circle, about 26cm, ready to use as a lid, Spoon the chilled filling into the pastry-lined dish. Brush the pastry edges with beaten egg, then lift the pastry lid over the filling. Crimp the pastry edges firmly together with a fork, or pinch together using your thumb and forefinger, then trim away any excess pastry. Brush the top with beaten egg and make a small slit to let out the steam. Bake the pie for 30-35 minutes until golden brown. Leave to rest for 10-15 minutes before serving. NOSTALGIC BAKES 52 BEEF & POTATO PITHIVIER SERVES 4 - 6 This appealing French pie takes my nan's mince and onion filling (see page 52) to another level. In this recipe, it's important to use good puff pastry, made with butter- I prefer to roll out a block but you can use pre-rolled- and to mark it carefully with the tip of a knife in the traditional way. 500g block of ready-made all-butter puff pastry 1 quantity mince and onion filling (see page 52), cooked and chilled 1 medium egg, beaten, to glaze Cut the puff pastry block into two pieces, roughly two-thirds and one-third. Roll the smaller piece of pastry to a 4mm thickness and cut out a 25cm diameter circle for the pie base. Lift this onto a baking tray. Roll out the remaining pastry and cut out a larger circle, about 28cm, for the pie lid. Spoon the chilled mince and onion filling onto the pastry base, leaving a 2cm clear margin around the edge. Brush the pastry edge with beaten egg. Lift the pie lid into position over the filling and press the pastry edges together to seal. Use the tip of a sharp knife to score two horizontal lines around the side of the pie (this helps it to rise better). Brush the top of the pie with beaten egg. Now lightly score parallel curved lines, radiating from the centre to the edge of the pastry; this is to create a decorative effect- don't cut through the pastry. Make a small hole in the centre of the pie to let out the steam. Place the pie in the fridge for at least 30 minutes to rest. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Bake the pie for 35-40 minutes, until the pastry is risen and golden. Leave to stand for at least 5 minutes before cutting. NOSTALGIC BAKES 55 FINGER RO LS FOR HOT DOGS OR FISH FINGERS MAKES 12 These long rolls, with their soft, slightly sweet centre, are the perfect casing for hot dogs or fish fingers, so I've also included a great recipe for home-made fish fingers opposite. Before cooking them, I coat the fish in salt and sugar, then wash it off. This draws out some of the moisture and means you get SOOg strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting lOg instant dried yeast lOg fine salt 40g caster sugar 50gunsalted butter, cut into small dice, softened 170rnl whole milk About 150rnl cold water Oil, for oiling a firmer texture and better flavour. Put the flour into a large bowl and add the yeast to one side and the salt and sugar to the other. Add the butter, milk and three-quarters of the water. Stir the mixture together with the fingers of one hand. Gradually add the remaining water a little at a time until all the flour is incorporated and you have a rough dough. The dough should be soft but not soggy. (You may not need all the w~ter or you may need a little more; it depends on the flour.) Tip the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it for 5-10 minutes. At first it will be wet but as you knead it will become smooth and silky. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover ll?d leave to rise until doubled in size. This will take at least an hour and can take up to 3 hours, depending on the temperature. Line two baking trays with baking parchment. Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces. Roll each into a ball between the palms of your hands, then roll into fingers, about ~2cm long, on alightlyfloured surface. Place 6 fingers on each of the prepared trays, leaving a 1cm gap between to allow a little room for them to expand- but not too much as you want them to be touching once risen: Place each tray in a large, clean plastic bag and leave to prove for 45-60 minutes, until doubled in size. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 220°C/ Gas 7. Remove the trays from the plastic bags. Dust the finger rolls with flour and·bake for 10-15 minutes, until golden brown. Leave on the t;.rays for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool. They are perfect filled with sausages and ketchup, or the fish fingers on the opposite page. NOSTALGIC BAKES 56 HOME-MADE FISH FINGERS Cut 400g skinned and boned haddock or cod loin fish into 12 fingers, each about Bern long and l .Scm wide. Mix 70g fine salt and 70g caster sugar together in a bpwl. Coat each fish finger in the salt and sugar mix then place on a baking tray. Leave for 30 minutes or so, to draw out any liquid from the fish and firm up the flesh. Take 3 shallow bowls: put 50gplain flour in one, lightly beat 2large eggs in another, and tip 150g golden breadcrumbs into the third. Carefully rinse all the salt and sugar from the fish and pat dry with kitchen paper. Dip each fish finger in flour, dusting off any excess, then dip in the egg and finally coat in the breadcrumbs. Dip each fish finger again in the egg and crumbs to give a second coating. In a large frying Pllfl. heat eno~gh sunflower oil to shallow-fry the fish fingers. Fry them in batches until golden brown and crispy, turning once. SESAME-TOPPED BUNS FOR BURGERS MAKES 8 The first burger I ever ate was at a Wimpy, when that restaurant chain was the coolest thing on the planet. Here's my recipe for home-made buns with sesame seeds on top, to make your burger special. I've also given a recipe for the burgers, as making your own means you can use good-quality mince and add extra tasty seasoning. 500g strong white bread fl. our, plus extra for dusting 7gfinesalt 7ginstantdriedyeast 40gunsalted butter, cut into small dice, softened 2 tsp caster sugar About 225rnl whole mi1J< About lOOrnl cold water 50g sesame seeds, for sprinkling Oil, for oiling Put the flour into a large bowl and add the salt to one side and the yeast to the other. Tip in the butter pieces and sugar. Combine the milk and water in a jug, then pour three-quarters into the flour mixture and turn the mixture around with the fingers of one hand to mix. Continue to add the remaining liquid, a little at a time, until all the flour is incorporated. The dough needs to be soft, but not soggy. (You may not need all the liquid or you may need a little more; it depends on the flour.) Tip the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it for 5-10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Place in a lightly oiled bowl, cover and leave to rise for about an hour. Line two baking trays with baking parchment. Tip the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knead to knock out any air. Divide the dough into 8 equal pieces and shape each into a smooth ball by placing it in a cage formed by your cupped hand on the work surface and moving your hand around in a circular motion, rotating the ball rapidly. Place on the trays, allowing room to spread. Place each baking tray in a large, clean plastic b<!-g and leave the rolls to prove until doubled in size. This will take about an hour or longer, depending on the temperature. Heat your oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Just before baking, remove the trays from the plastic bags. Brush the tops of the rolls with water and sprinkle with sesame seeds. Bake for 15 minutes then lower the oven setting to 160°C/Gas 3 and bake for a further 5-10 minutes, until risen and golden brown. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. MY HOME-MADE BURGERS Heat 2 tsp oil in a frying pan and cook 1 diced, small onion gently until softened; leave to cool. Put 100g fresh breadcrumbs into a large bowl, pour on 100ml milk and leave to soak for 5 minutes or until all the milk is absorbed. Add 600g good-quality minced beef, the cooled onion, 1 crushed garlic clove, 1 tsp mustard powder, Y2 tsp celery salt and Y2 tsp fine salt. Work with your hands, squeezing the mixture together so it is thoroughly combined. Divide the mixture into 8 equal pieces, roll into balls and flatten to shape into burgers. Cover loosely with cling film and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes to firm up slightly until ready to cook. Heat your grill to high. Place the burgers on a baking tray and grill, about 6-7cm from the heat, for 6 minutes. Turn over and cook the other side for 6 mi,nutes or until the meat is cooked through. Serve each burger in a sesame-topped bun with lettuce, sliced tomato, gherkins, sliced red onion and mayonnaise. I DEF Y ANYONE TO MAKE oneloafandnevermakeanother. All it takes is that little bit of ambition to have a go in the first place- and it's easier than you think. Bread-making machines can be a good way to start, as all you have to do is weigh up ingredients and then leave the machine to it. The next step is to make a loaf that you knead yourself; you'll have more control this way because when you touch a dough, you can feel that it's lively and good, and you can smell it as well. How did I learn? In my mid-teens, I'd followed my mum's path and went to Wallasey Art School, where I got particularly into sculpture. My dad now lived in York and had a chain of about eighteen bakeries. When Dad asked me ifi wanted to become a baker, I initially said no. Then he offered to pay me £500- a lot of money in those days- ifi'd cut my long hair and join the industry. That put things in a different light for a seventeen-year-old! I set out to become a baker. My dad put me to work with the best guys he had at each of the bakeries, to train me in their particular skills; they were mostly old school bakers and all great at their jobs. I also picked up the basic know-how of working in a bakery, such as not to just grab a tray but always tap it first to avoid getting burnt. Being the son of the boss means you always get the toughest jobs. I had a lot to prove, so I had to work twice as hard as anyone else. The shift started at one o'clock in the morning and we finished about ten hours later. I used to like working through the night, when it was quiet, finishing midway through the day with a huge sense of relief. But this was six days a week and it was gruelling work. I was only young when I started, and I was working alongside big stocky lads from Bootle. These lads were much bigger than me and they were lugging flour bags I could barely lift- a minimum of16kg BEGINNER'S BREAD 62 r- -- - --~ I and you'd sometimes carry a couple on each shoulder when the flour delivery for the week came on a Thursday. You build up your body quickly carrying sacks like that, as well as big hot trays on your fingertips. Within six months, I was as quick and strong as they were. When you begin as an apprentice baker, you're a mixing lad or a table hand. Mixing starts with measuring. This is as important for the home baker as for the professional. If you don't weigh up the ingredients properly at the beginning- a half ounce out, either way - you've screwed up the whole process. And, just as for the home baker, the quality of the ingredients has got to be right: put rubbish in, you'll get rubbish out. The next job I learnt was to 'scale off' llb or 2lb pieces of dough on an old-fashioned scale with weights on one side and a pan on the other. You had to do it quick: bang, bang, bang, bang. There might be six or seven guys waiting to mould the dough into cobs, cottage loaves or tin loaves. After that, you moved on to the table. Moulding is a manual skill. Once you've got it, it never leaves you. Some are faster than others; I tended to be fairly quick. I am rubbish at academic stuff, but manual? You show me something once and I won't stop until I've mastered it. Finally comes the most important job- and this person really runs the bakery - feeding the oven. My first was an eight-foot oven with five decks and three trays on each one. I twas huge and made your back strain from lifting trays and filling it from top to bottom. You cannot, cannot have an empty space in the oven from the moment you start to the end of the day. Electric or gas, that oven's costing you money and you have to keep it baking at all times. You spend the whole shift juggling and figuring out where the heat is in your oven and the best position to bake things in. Every deck has its own character. You have to know where the BEGINNER'S BREAD 63 - hot spots are, the best place for the Genoise or the barm cakes. Learn to love your oven and it can be your best friend - or else it can be your worst enemy. In a bakery shift, you start with the breads. Because they need the greatest heat, they go in when the oven has been fired up. You pop the meringues in last thing, when the oven is cooling down, leave the oven door open and take the trays out the next day, first thing. Early on, I made the classic mistake of coming in, closing the oven door, firing up the oven and burning all the meringues. My dad's chain ofbakeries was what we called 'hot bread shops', designed so you could see and talk to the baker working at the back. Old dears would come in and say, 'Put that loafback in and burn it for me.' They like bread darker in the North, with more of a caramel colour and a crust; down South they prefer it lighter. Looking back, working in this type of shop meant I saw that bakers didn't have to be stuck away but could be out and about, talking about what we do. One day when I was working in the Lincoln shop, the head baker didn't turn up. As assistant baker, I took over. It all turned out beautifully. I was really proud of the cakes, scones, pies, breads, baps, harms, sticks, tin breads. Everything was great. I thought: I understand now. All it took was someone to be off for me to take responsibility and to do it myself. The lessons I learnt translate to home baking. First of all, get stuck in. Making bread is so satisfying and every time you learn more about each stage. Get a decent set of digital scales and weigh your ingredients accurately. Get your oven clean so you haven't got hot spots in there. Try not to open the oven door too often. Ideally, have an oven with a glass front and clean the front window, then either turn the light on inside or use a torch if you need to look inside without opening the door. Make the same recipe several times and, best of all, take notes of what the difference is between bakes. BEGINNER ' S BREAD 65 The initial mixing of the dry ingredients takes place in a large bowl. The flour goes in first, followed by the salt and yeast. It's important to keep these two ingredients separate- adding them to opposite sides of the bowl - as the sal twill slow down (or even kill) the yeast in its concentrated form. Different flours absorb different amounts of water. Add about three-quarters of the water quantity given in a recipe and mix it into the flour with your hands, adding as much as you need of the rest, or some more. You learn how to feel how much water is needed through experience. For continental breads or sourdough loaves with a more open structure, wetter is better. It is easier to mix very wet doughs, such as baguette dough, in a food mixer. You then tip the whole dough out onto a work surface. If it's a dough with butter in it, I'd use a little dusting of flour. For other doughs, I began to advise oiling the work surface because so many people were coming up to me and saying that their bread was tight, with small holes and a poor rise. This can partly be down to putting too much flour on the work surface as you knead. By oiling the surface instead, you keep the dough soft, it doesn't stick so much and, crucially, you don't get any more flour going in. There is no hard-and-fast rule for kneading bread. Some people slap a wet dough on the work surface, some people stretch it. I tend to constantly roll, roll, stretch, stretch. Each of these techniques builds up the gluten that makes the bread rise and hold its shape. Everyone has a way that works for them. You then need to let the dough rise. Slower is better as it means more flavour. That's why I recommend using cold rather than warm water and leaving the dough in a cool place - even the fridge sometimes- so that the yeast works less quickly. Some of the doughs in this chapter use relatively little yeast, which also promotes a slow rise. After the initial rise, you need to knock back and shape the dough. Knocking back gets rid of the air pockets and creates BEGINNER'S BREAD 66 a uniform texture so the dough rises evenly. To do this and to shape the dough, for most breads you just fold and fold. It's a bit like folding paper: the dough becomes stronger, and the finished loafis more able to hold its shape. This is especially important for breads you make without a tin. For baguettes, I let the dough rise in a square or rectangular tub that's not too deep- an old ice-cream tub works well- so you can tip the dough onto the work surface without losing too much air. You then knock it back less, and shape the loaf more carefully. Next comes the final rise, or proving. Give dough plenty of time to prove. Again, you learn by touch when a loaf is ready to go in the oven: it should spring back when gently pressed with a finger. You want to catch the dough when it is at the top of its rise, before the yeast is exhausted and the dough stops rising and starts to slacken. For novices, I'd recommend starting with soda bread, without a shadow of a doubt. It's simple and doesn't need proving at all. Kids won't be bored and it'll take 45 minutes from the time you start to the time you bring it out of the oven. The next stage is making bread in a tin. There's only one way that a tin bread can rise, and that's up. Then make rolls and build up to bigger cobs. Finally you can get on to sourdough, which is more complex and harder to handle but worth the effort; for some it's really the ultimate bread. Once you've finished your loaf and it's come out of the oven, the killer is leaving it to cool when all you want to do is eat it. Leave it on your wire rack, admire it, photograph it, Instagram it, Tweet it, tell all your friends. Then you slice it. The time you really want your own loaf is in the morning when you wake up and remember that you've got that bread downstairs that you made yesterday. Stick a slice in the toaster. Butter, jam or marmalade, mug of tea, first bite: that's when you realise your life has changed forever. BEGINNER'S BREAD 67 FLOURYBAPS MAKES 12 These are my version of the rolls that my dad made at the weekend and left to prove in front of our gas fire. This was the first recipe that really showed me the magic ofbread; how ingredients put together from the cupboard would mysteriously rise and then make a bake with a beautiful home-made taste. 500g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting 7ginstant driedyeast 7gfinesalt 40g caster sugar 40gunsalted butter, cut into small pieces, softened About 320ml cold water Oil, for oiling Put the flour into a large bowl and add the yeast to one side and the salt and sugar to the other. Add the butter and about three-quarters of the water. Turn the mixture around with the fingers of one hand to mix, gradually adding more of the water, until you have picked up all the flour. The dough needs to be soft but not soggy. (You may not need all of the water or you may need a little more; it depends on the flour.) Tip the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it for 5- 10 minutes. At first the dough will be wet but as you knead it will become smooth and silky. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a clean tea towel and leave to rise until doubled in size. This will take at least an hour and can take 2-3 hours or longer. 1 j Tip the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and fold it inwards repeatedly until all the airis knocked out. Atthis stage, you're starting to form the structure of the dough so it rises upwards rather than spreading outwards. Divide the dough into 12 equal pieces. (Until you can instinctively determine the correct size of each roll, it's a good idea to weigh the whole dough and divide the figure by 12, then check you have the correct weight for each piece.) Lightly dust your work surface with flour. Shape each piece of dough into a smooth ball by placing it in a cage formed by your cupped hand on the work surface and moving your hand around in a circular motion, rotating the ball rapidly. Sitthe rolls on a floured surface and cover with a clean tea towel. Leave to rest for 30 minutes. Line two baking trays with baking parchment. Remove the tea towel and use a rolling pin to flatten each ball of dough so it doubles in width. Place on the prepared trays, leaving enough space in between for them to expand. Place each tray in a large, clean plastic bag and leave to prove for 45-60 minutes, or until doubled in size. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 220°C/Gas 7. Remove the trays from the bags and lightly dust the surface of the rolls with flour. Bake for 10-15 minutes or until risen and golden brown. Leave to cool on the tray for 5 minutes and then transfer to a wire rack to finish cooling. TV ROLLS MAKES 6 These are known as 'TV rolls' because of the square mould used to cut them out in bakeries, including my dad's. You'll discover that they go slightly odd shapes when they bake, but that doesn't matter. 500gstrongwhite bread flour, plus extra for dusting lOg instant dried yeast lOg fine salt 20g unsalted butter, cut into small pieces, softened About 320rnl cold water Oil, for oiling Put the flour into a large bowl and add the yeast to one side and the salt to the other. Add the butter and pour in three-quarters of the water. Turn the mixture around with the fingers of one hand to mix then continue to add more of the water, a little at a time, until all the flour is incorporated and you have a rough dough. The dough needs to be soft but not soggy. (You may not need all the water or you may need a little more; it depends on the flour.) Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it for 5-10 minutes, working through the wet stage until it becomes soft and smooth. Put the dough into a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a clean tea towel and leave to rise until doubled in size. This will take at least an hour and can take 2-3 hours or longer, depending on the room temperature. Line a roasting tin (not a shallow baking tray) with baking parchment. Tip the dough onto a lightly floured work surface and fold it inwards repeatedly to knock out the air. Shape the dough into a chunky rectangle, 4-5cm high. Cut this into 6 equal squares, using a sharp knife or pizza wheel. Place the rolls in the prepared tin, leaving enough space in between for them to double in size. Place the roasting tin in a large, clean plastic bag and leave to prove for about an hour until the rolls have doubled in size. The dough is ready when it springs back when lightly prodded. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 200°C/ Gas 6. Remove the tin from the bag and dust the rolls with flour. Bake for 15 minutes, or until the rolls are risen and golden brown. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. BEGINNER'S BREAD 70 MAKES 1 LARGE LOAF This is the staple white bread that my dad used to make in his bakeries. It uses a small amount of yeast and a lengthy eight-hour fermentation, because allowing the dough to rise slowly gives the best flavour. 500g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting 2g instant dried yeast (Y. tsp) lOg fine salt 40gunsalted butter, cut into small pieces, softened About 320rnl cold water Oil, for oiling Put the flour into a large bowl and add the yeast to one side and the salt to the other. Don't put the salt onto the yeast, as it can kill the yeast, or at the very least slow it down. Add the butter and three-quarters of the water. Turn the mixture around with the fingers of one hand to mix and continue to add the remaining water, a little at a time, until all the flour is incorporated. The dough needs to be soft but not soggy. (You may not need all of the water or you may need a little more; it depends on the flour.) Tip the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it for 5-10 minutes. Work it well, going through the initial wet stage until the dough becomes smooth and elastic. Put the dough into a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a clean tea towel and leave to rise in a cool place (but not the fridge) for at least 8 hours or overnight. Taking time over this stage helps the dough to develop more flavour. Lightly oil a 900g (2lb) loaf tin. Tip the dough onto a lightly floured surface and fold it inwards repeatedly until all the air is knocked out. At this stage, you are starting to form the structure of the dough to encourage it to rise upwards rather than spreading outwards (the tin also helps with this). Shape the dough into an oblong by flattening it and folding the sides into the middle. Roll up the dough so the top is smooth and you have a join in the middle on the underside. Place the dough in the prepared tin with the join underneath. Put the loaf tin inside a large, clean plastic bag and leave the loaf to prove until it has doubled in size. This will take at least an hour and can take 2-3 hours. The dough is ready when it springs back quickly when gently prodded with a finger. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 220°C/Gas 7 and place a roasting tin in the bottom. BEGINN ER' S BREAD 72 Remove the proved loaf from the bag. Dust the surface of the loaf with flour and then use a sharp knife to make a 2cm deep slash along the top, nearly to the ends. Carefully pour enough hot water into the tin in the oven to almost fill it- this will create steam. Bake the loaf for 15 minutes then lower the oven setting to 190°C/ Gas 5 and bake for a further 25- 30 minutes. Remove the loaf from the tin and tap the base: it should sound hollow. If not, put the loafback in the tin and return to the oven for another 5 minutes. Remove the loaf from the tin and transfer to a wire rack. Leave to cool completely. WHOLEMEAL TIN LOAF MAKES 1 LARGE LOAF Wholemeal flour keeps the best bits of the wheat kernel and more of the fibre than white flour, resulting in a loaf with more nutrients and flavour- you can really taste the earthiness, especially if you use stoneground flour. It's one of my favourite ingredients and makes a loaf that I love. Like the split tin loaf on the previous page, it has a small amount of yeast and a long, slow fermentation, to allow the dough to rise slowly for optimum flavour. 350g strong stoneground wholemeal bread flour, plus extra for dusting the loaf 150g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting the work surface 2g instant dried yeast (Y. tsp) lOg fine salt 40gunsalted butter, cut into small pieces, softened 20g malt extract About 340ml cold water Oil, for oiling Put both flours into a large bowl and add the yeast to one side and the salt to the other. Add the butter, malt extract and about three-quarters of the water. Turn the mixture around with the fingers of one hand to mix (or use a round-bladed knife first and then your fingers) and continue to add more of the water, a little at a time, until all of the flour is incorporated. The dough needs to be soft but not soggy. (You may not need all of the water or you may need a little more; it depends on the flour.) Tip the dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knead for 5-10 minutes, working the dough through the initial wet stage until it is smooth and silky. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl. Cover with a clean tea towel and leave to rise in a cool place (but not the fridge) for at least 8 hours or overnight. This long, slow rise allows plenty of time for the flavour to develop. Lightly oil a 900g (2lb) loaf tin. Tip the dough onto a lightly floured surface and fold it inwards repeatedly until all the air is knocked out. Shape the dough into an oblong by flattening it and folding the sides into the middle. Roll up the dough so the top is smooth and you have a join in the middle on the underside. Place in the prepared loaf tin with the join underneath. Putthe tin inside a large, clean plastic bag and leave until doubled in size. This will take at least an hour and can take 2-3 hours, depending on the room temperature. When you prod it lightly with your finger, the dough should spring back quickly. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 220°C/Gas 7 and put a roasting tin in the bottom. BEGINNER'S BREAD 74 . , I ~ Remove the tin from the plastic bag and dust the surface of the loaf with wholemeal flour. Use a sharp knife to make a 2cm deep slash along the top, almost to the ends.

Bake the loaf for 15 minutes then lower the oven setting to 190°C/ Gas 5 and bake for a further 25-30 minutes. Remove the loaf from the tin and tap the base: it should sound hollow. If not, put back in the tin and bake for another 5 minutes. Remove the loaf from the tin and transfer to a wire rack. Leave to cool completely. COTTAGE LOAF MAKES 1 LARGE LOAF Traditionally, bakers used to bake what were called 'oven bottom breads' on the floor of the oven in order to get a heavier, tastier crust. At home, we bake such loaves on a tray and the recipe can be formed into any shape you like- cob, bloomer or, as here, into a classic cottage loaf. Make sure you shape the loaf well so it rises and holds without the help of a loaf tin . 500g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting 5g instant dried yeast 7gfine salt 50g lard, cut into small pieces, softened About 350ml cold water Oil, for oiling ..... Put the flour into a large bowl and add the yeast to one side and the salt to the other. Add the lard and pour in about three-quarters of the water. Turn the mixture around with the fingers of one hand to mix then continue to add more of the water, a little at a time, until all the flour is incorporated. The dough needs to be soft but not soggy. (You may not need all the water or you may need a little more; it depends on the flour.) Tip the dough onto a lightly oiled surface and knead for 5-10 minutes, working through the initial wet stage until it is smooth and silky. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a clean tea towel and leave to rise until doubled in size. This will take at least an hour and can take 2-3 hours or longer, depending on the room temperature. Line a baking tray with baking parchment. Tip the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and fold it inwards repeatedly until all the air is knocked out. At this stage, you're starting to form the structure of the dough so it rises upwards rather than spreading outwards. This is especially important in a free-standing loafwithout a tin to support the bread's rise. Tear off a third of the dough and set aside. Shape the larger piece into a ball. To do this, first flatten the dough into a rough rectangle then roll it up into a thick oblong. Repeat this several times, getting the dough nice and tight. Now fold the two ends in towards the centre and press them down, so you end up with a chunky, squarish shape. Turn the dough over, so that the join is underneath. Continued overleaf BEGINNER ' S BREAD 76 With your palms turned upwards, put your hands on each side, slightly under the dough. Move the cob around, slightly pushing the dough neatly under itself as it turns. You are gently forcing the sides of the dough down and underneath, to create a smooth, taut top. Try to avoid using too much extra flour during shaping if you can. Slightly flatten the ball of dough and place on the prepared baking tray. Shape the other piece of dough into a smaller ball, using the same technique, and flatten slightly. Place the smaller ball on top of the larger ball. Dust your middle finger and forefinger with flour and push them through the centre of the loaf all the way to the bottom. This helps to join the two pieces firmly together. Use a sharp knife to make vertical slashes at even intervals around the top and lower parts of the loaf. Place the tray inside a large, clean plastic bag and leave the dough to prove for at least an hour, or until well risen. When prodded lightly with your finger, the dough should spring back quickly. Don't rush this stage; if the shaped loaf is under-proved it can spring up in the oven and tip over. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 220°C/ Gas 7. Remove the proved loaf from the bag and dust with flour. Bake for 15 minutes, then lower the oven setting to 190°C/ Gas 5 and bake for a further 20-25 minutes, until crusty and golden brown. When tapped on the bottom, the loaf should sound hollow. If not, put it back into the oven for another 5 minutes. Transfer the cooked loaf to a wire rack to cool. BEGINNER'S BREAD 78 GRANA YSTICKS MAKES 6 Granary (or malted) flour changed the way people thought ofbread when it became popular in the seventies and eighties. It is essentially white flour with added flakes of malted wheat, and a nutty flavour. We called these 'sticks' in the bakeries where I worked because they are long, thin rolls, like mini- baguettes. You'll need to make the dough a day ahead, as it has along, slow rise. Olive oil, for oiling 150g strongwhite bread flour, plus extra for dusting 225g granary (malted) flour 5g instant dried yeast 7gfinesalt 350ml cold water Lightly oil a 2- 3litre rectangular or square plastic container, such as an ice-cream tub. (It's important to use this type of container as it helps shape the dough and improve its structure.) Put the flours into a food mixer fitted with the dough hook. (As this dough is wet and tricky to handle, and needs along knead, it's far easier to use a mixer.) Add the yeast to one side and the salt to the other. Start mixing on a slow speed, then slowly add the water. As the dough starts to come together, continue to mix on a slow speed for 5 minutes and then increase the speed to medium and mix for a further 10- 15 minutes or until you have a glossy, elastic dough. The dough should be very elastic and when pulled it should stretch so it's almost transparent without breaking. If it breaks, continue to mix for another 5 minutes. Tip the dough into the prepared tub, cover with a clean tea towel and leave it to rise in the fridge for 24 hours. Line two baking trays with baking parchment, or use a bread stick tray. Coat the work surface with a little olive oil then carefully tip the dough onto it. Rather than knocking it back, handle the dough gently so you keep as much air in as possible. This helps to create the irregular, airy texture of a really good baguette. The dough will be wet to the touch but still lively. Divide the dough into 6 pieces. Shape each piece into an oblong by flattening the dough out slightly and folding the sides up into the middle. Then roll up each piece into a sausage -the top should be smooth with ajoin running along the length of the base. Beginning in the middle, roll out each sausage with your hands to lengthen it. Don't force the dough to elongate by pressing heavily. BEGINNER'S BREAD 80 Concentrate on the backwards and forwards movement and gently use the weight of your arms to roll out the dough to about 15cm in length; the sticks should be about Scm in diameter. Lay the bread sticks on the prepared trays and place each tray inside a large, clean plastic bag. Leave to prove in the fridge for 24 hours. The long proving time helps the dough to develop more flavour. Heat your oven to 220°C/Gas 7 and put a roasting tin in the bottom of the oven to heat up. Remove the trays from the bags and dust the bread sticks lightly with more white flour . Carefully pour enough hot water into the roasting tin in the oven to almost fill it- this will create steam. Bake the granary sticks for 20 minutes or until they are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped on the bottom. Transfer to a wire racK: to cool. MILK LOAF MAKES 1 LARGE LOAF With its soft crumb and rich taste, this loafis popular in theN orth and has always been a firm favourite in my family. Traditionally, it's made in a cylindrical tin marked with round circles, which helps prevent a thick crust forming and gives a soft, springy loaf. ----------------------~------------~----~------~··~--------------- 500g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting 7g instant dried yeast 7gfinesalt 60g unsalted butter, cut into small pieces, softened About 340ml whole milk Oil, for oiling Put the flour in a large bowl and add the yeast to one side and the salt to the other.

Put the tin inside a large, clean plastic bag and leave to prove until the dough has doubled in size and springs back quickly when lightly prodded with a finger. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Remove the proved loaf from the bag. If using a milk loaf tin, place the other half of the tin on top and close. Bake the loaf for 30-35 minutes, until golden brown. Remove the loaf from the tin and place on a wire rack. Leave to cool completely.

Put the olive oil and peeled whole garlic cloves into a small pan over a low heat and simmer gently for 15-20 minutes, until soft but not coloured. Remove the garlic with a slotted spoon and set aside to cool. Put the flour into a food mixer fitted with the dough hook. Add the yeast to one side and the salt to the other and begin mixing on a slow speed. Now gradually add the water. As the dough starts to come together, add the cooled garlic cloves and continue to mix on a slow speed for 5 minutes. Increase the speed to medium and mix for a further 10 minutes until you have a glossy, very elastic dough. When pulled, the dough should stretch so it's almost transparent without breaking. If it breaks, continue to mix for another 5 minutes. Tip the dough into the prepared tub, cover and leave to prove in the fridge for 24 hours. Line a baking tray with baking parchment, or use a baguette tray. Coat the work surface with a little olive oil and then carefully tip the dough onto it. Rather than knocking it back, handle the dough gently so you keep in as much air as possible. This will help to create the irregular, airy texture of a really good baguette. The dough will be wet to the touch but still lively. Divide the dough in half. Shape each piece into an oblong by flattening the dough out slightly and folding the sides up into the middle. Turn over and carefully roll each piece of dough up into a sausage- the top should be smooth with a join underneath, running along the length ofthebase. BEGINNER ' S BREAD 86 r-- Beginning in the middle, roll out each sausage with your hands to elongate; don't force the dough to lengthen by pressing heavily. Concentrate on the backwards and forwards movement and gently use the weight of your arms to roll out the dough to a baguette shape. Place the baguettes on the prepared tray and put it into a large, clean plastic bag. Leave to prove in the fridge for 24 hours. Heat your oven to 220°C/Gas 7 and put a roasting tin in the bottom to heat up. Remove the tray from the bag. Dust the baguettes lightly with flour. Use a sharp knife to make 3 or 4long, diagonal slashes, about 2cm deep, in the top of each loaf. Carefully pour enough hot water into the roasting tin in the oven to almost fill it- this will create steam. Slide the tray ofbread into the oven and bake for 20 minutes, until the baguettes are golden brown and sound hollow when tapped on the bottom. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. For the garlic butter, place all the ingredients in a food processor and mix until smooth. To turn the baguettes into garlic bread, have your oven at 180°C/Gas 4. Make vertical cuts three-quarters of the way down into one baguette, at 4cm intervals (make sure you don't cut all the way through). Spread garlic butter into the gaps between the slices and then all over the surface of the baguette. Repeat with the other baguette. Wrap each baguette in foil and bake for 15 minutes. Open the foil fully then bake for a further 5 minutes to crisp the bread. Photographs overleaf BEGINNER'S BREAD 87 CARAMELISED ONION SODA BREAD MAKES 1 LOAF I love soda bread and I really like a good onion-flavoured loaf. The beauty of soda bread is that it's so simple to make, and with no proving required you achieve quick results. Adding extra flavours to a basic soda loaf, as I have done here, takes it to another level. ----------------------~----------------~-------~----------------- 1 tbsp sunflower oil 15gunsalted butter 2 onions, finely sliced 1 tbsp soft dark brown sugar 2 bushy sprigs of thyme, leaves picked 1 tsp fine salt, plus a pinch for the onions 250g plain white flour, plus extra for dusting 250g plain wholemeal flour 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda 400ml buttermilk Heat the oil and butter in a large frying pan. Once the butter has melted, add the onions and stir to coat. Cook slowly over a low heat, stirring occasionally, for about 20 minutes until the onions are softened. Add the sugar, thyme and a pinch of salt. Continue to cook until the onions turn golden brown, stirring occasionally to stop them burning. Tip onto a plate and leave to cool. Heat your oven to 200°C/Gas 6 and line a large baking tray with baking parchment. Put both flours into a large bowl with the salt and bicarbonate of soda and mix well. Make a well in the centre and add the caramelised onions and half the buttermilk. Use the fingers of one hand (or a round-bladed knife and then your fingers) to draw the flour into the buttermilk. Continue to add the buttermilk until all the flour has been incorporated and you have a sticky, malleable dough. You may not need all the buttermilk (depending on the flour- different brands absorb slightly more or less liquid). Tip the dough onto a floured surface, shape into a ball and flatten slightly. Place on the prepared baking tray. Use a large sharp knife to mark the loaf into quarters, cutting deeply into the dough but not quite through the base. Dust the top of the loaf with flour. Bake for 30-35 minutes until the loaf is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the base. You can carefully cut along one of the seams to see if the inside is cooked through; if not, put the loafback in the oven for 5 minutes or so. Transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Soda bread is best eaten on the day it is made, or at least within a day or two. It also freezes well. BEGINNER'S BREAD 90 STILTON & WALNUT SODA BREAD MAKES 1 LOAF Adding extra flavours to bread dough is popular these days but it was rare when I started out. Blue cheese works well in all types ofbread and becomes even more special when combined with walnuts in this savoury soda bread. 500g plain white flour, plus extra for dusting 1 tsp fine salt 1 tsp bicarbonate of soda 100g walnut pieces 200g Stilton, crumbled 400mlbuttermilk Heat your oven to 200°C/Gas 6 and line a large baking tray with baking parchment. Put the flour, salt and bicarbonate of soda into a large bowl and mix well. Add the walnuts and Stilton and stir gently. Make a well in the centre of the mixture and pour in half the buttermilk. Using the fingers of one hand (or a round-bladed knife and then your fingers), draw the flour into the buttermilk. Continue to add the buttermilk until all the flour has been incorporated and you have a sticky dough. You may not need all the buttermilk (different brands of flour absorb slightly more or less liquid). Tip the dough onto a floured surface, shape into a ball and then flatten slightly. Place on the prepared baking tray. Use a large sharp knife to mark the loaf into quarters, cutting deeply into the dough but not quite through the base. Dust the top of the loaf with flour. Bake for 30-35 minutes until the loaf is golden brown and sounds hollow when tapped on the base. You can carefully cut along one of the seams to see if the inside is cooked through; if not, put the loafback in the oven for 5 minutes or so. Transfer the soda bread to a wire rack and leave to cool completely. It is best eaten on the day it is made, or at least finished within a day or two. It also freezes well. BEGINNER'S BREAD 93 ROQUEFO T &ALMOND SOURDOUGH MAKES 1 LA RGE LO AF I used to supply this bread to Harrods and atthe time it hit the headlines as 'the most expensive bread in Britain', selling at £25 per loaf. To be fair, it was a big 2kg loaf- and the salty-sweet mix ofblue cheese and nuts does turn humble bread into a star turn. A banneton- a special wicker proving basket - is especially useful for wetter doughs such as sourdoughs, to keep the shape and lift. You will need to prepare the starter a few days ahead. ------·_.--------------------·--------~~--_.~------~~~~uw--~----~----- For the sourdough starter 250g strongwhite bread flour 6 organic, seedless green grapes, chopped 250mlwater To refresh the starter (each time) lOOgstrongwhite bread flour lOOmlwater For the loaf Oil, for oiling 375g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting 200g sourdough starter (see above) 7gfinesalt About 175ml water lOOg Roquefort, crumbled into small pieces 125g blanched almonds, chopped medium-fine Fine semolina, for dusting To prepare the starter, in a bowl. mix the flour with the grapes and water. Transfer this mixture to a Kilner jar, close the lid and leave to ferment at warm room temperature (ideally 20-24°C). After 2-3 days the mixture should have started to grow and look lively, with bubbles on the surface. Once the mixture is active, discard half of it then add lOOg flour and lOOml water. This process is called 'feeding' the mixture and should be repeated every few days for as long as you have your starter. (You can keep a starter dormant between loaves by storing it in the fridge, bringing it back to room temperature and starting the feeding process again before using it.) After the starter has been fed, leave it for a day and the mixture should become thicker and have ajelly-like texture. Once at this stage it is ready to use. For the loaf, lightly oil a 2-3litre square or rectangular plastic container, such as an ice-cream tub. Mix the flour, starter and salt together in a large bowl then mix in just enough water to form a soft dough, using a spoon first, then your hands. Lightly oil your work surface, tip the dough onto it and knead for at least 10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Place the dough in the oiled plastic container and cover with cling film. Leave to rise until doubled in size. This can take up to 5 hours or longer, depending on the temperature and the vigour of your starter. Continued overleaf BEGINNER'S BREAD 94 When the dough is ready, mix equal quantities of flour and semolina together in a small bowl and use to dust your work surface generously. Gently tip the dough onto the surface and flatten into a rectangle. Scatter the cheese and chopped almonds over the surface then fold the dough in on itself a few times to incorporate them. Flatten the dough into a rectangle again and bring the sides into the middle to meet, so you get a chunky squareish shape. Turn the dough over so the join is now on the bottom. Shape the dough into a ball by cupping it with the sides of your hands and turning it around to create a smooth ball. (This is looser than a standard bread dough and so more difficult to handle; you can dust your hands with flour to make the task less sticky.) Dust a round banneton basket or a medium bowl liberally with flour or the flour and semolina mix. Add the ball of dough, inverting it so that it sits smooth side down. Put inside a large, clean plastic bag and leave to prove until doubled in size. This is likely to take somewhere between 4 and 8 hours, possibly even longer. Don't rush this stage; it's important for developing the flavour and structure of the loaf. Heat your oven to 220°C/ Gas 7 and put a roasting tin in the bottom to heat up. Heavily dust a baking tray with the flour and semolina mix. Tip the bread onto the tray and use a scalpel or sharp knife to slash a 2cm deep cross on the top. Carefully pour enough hot water into the roasting tin in the oven to almost fill it- this will create steam. Put the bread into the oven and bake for 20 minutes, then lower the oven setting to 200°C/ Gas 6 and bake for a further 15 minutes. The loaf should be dark brown and sound hollow when tapped on the base. If not, put it back in the oven for another 5 minutes. Transfer the cooked loaf to a wire rack and leave to cool. BEGINNER'S BREAD 96 CRUMPETS MAKES ABOUT 10 Crumpets get their texture from two different rising stages: first a rise with yeast, then one with bicarbonate of soda to create the characteristic holes. Slow cooking on a griddle or in aheavyfryingpan gives the crumpets their brown base and flavour. They take a little practice to perfect; in particular, keep an eye on the heat throughout cooking. I've also included a tangy rarebit topping (overleaf) that turns them into a meal. 175gstrongwhite bread flour 175g plain white flour 14g instant dried yeast 1 tsp caster sugar 350rnl warm whole milk About 200rnl cold water Y. tsp bicarbonate of soda ltsp fine salt Sunflower oil, for cooking Put both flours into a large bowl and mix in the yeast. In a jug, dissolve the sugar in the warm milk, then pour onto the flour mixture. Use a wooden spoon to draw the dry ingredients into the liquid, then beat until the mixture forms a smooth batter. Beat the batter for a further 3minutes. Cover the bowl with a tea towel and leave to stand for 1 hour. The mixture will rise and then begin to fall- you will see marks on the side of the bowl where the batter reached before it dropped. This indicates that the yeast has created its carbon dioxide and is now exhausted. The gluten will have developed sufficiently to give the crumpets the structure to rise and hold their shape. In a jug, mix 150rnl water with the bicarbonate of soda and salt. Stir this into the batter until evenly combined, then gradually stir in as much of the remaining water as necessary to get a thick dropping consistency. Cover the bowl and leave the batter to rest for about 20 minutes. Small holes will appear on the surface and the batter will become a bit sticky. Heat a flat griddle or heavy-based frying pan over a medium-low heat. Lightly but thoroughly grease the inside of at least four 7 -Scm metal crumpet rings (ideally non-stick). Lightly grease the griddle or pan, using a crumpled kitchen paper dipped in oil. It's a good idea to start with a trial crumpet to get used to the heat of the pan and how your batter will cook (the first one is never the best, like the first pancake). Put a greased crumpet ring on the griddle or in the frying pan. Ladle enough batter into it to come just below the top of the ring. Continued overleaf BEGINNER'S BREAD 98 ---- --- - ---- - -~ After 6-8 minutes, the bottom of the crumpet should be browned and the rest almost cooked through. The top of the crumpet will be drier and almost set, and most of the bubbles on the top will have burst. You can slightly speed up the cookingbypoppingthese bubbles as they appear, with a skewer or the sharp tip of a knife; when the crumpet is ready, the bubbles will stay open rather than fill up with liquid batter. Turn the crumpet over carefully, using a spatula and a palette knife. Leave the crumpet to cook for a few more minutes then lift it out onto a wire rack. Run a small, sharp knife around the outside of the crumpet to loosen it and remove from the ring. Now you know the time and temperature needed for your batter, you are ready to cook the rest of the crumpets, in batches. CRUMPETS WITH RAREBIT TOPPING Have a batch of crumpets cooked and ready. For the rarebit topping, put 2 tbsp plain flour, 1% tsp mustard powder, 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce, 125ml milk or beer and 185g grated strong Cheddar into a saucepan. Bring to the boil, stirring, over a medium heat. Lower the heat and simmer until thickened and smooth, stirring constantly. Pour into a bowl and beat in 2 medium egg yolks. Cover with cling film and leave to cool, then refrigerate until needed. The rarebit will firm up once cold. Heat your grill to high. Toast the crumpets on both sides then place on a baking tray. Spread the rarebit on top of the crumpets and place under the grill until bubbling and golden brown. Eat at once. BEGINNER'S BREAD 100 • ENGLISH MUFFINS MAKES 8 A good English muffin- simply cut, toasted and buttered- is a thing ofbeauty, particularly if it's home-made. I used to make muffins for Eggs Benedict when I worked in hotels, and through doing this I discovered that the secret to good muffins is getting the heat just right and adjusting it as you cook. 300g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting 5g instant dried yeast ltsp fine salt 1 tbsp caster sugar 20g unsalted butter, cut into small pieces, softened 1 medium egg, beaten About 200rnl whole milk Oil, for oiling Fine semolina, for dusting Put the flour into a large bowl and add the yeast to one side and the salt to the other. Add the sugar, butter, egg and three-quarters of the milk. Turn the mixture around with the fingers of one hand to mix then continue to add more of the remaining milk until all the flour is incorporated. The dough needs to be soft but not soggy. (You may not need all the milk or you may need a little more; it depends on the flour.) Tip the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it for 5-10 minutes, until smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a clean tea towel and leave to rise for an hour or until doubled in size. Line two baking trays with baking parchment. Mix equal quantities of flour and semolina together in a small bowl and use to lightly dust your work surface. Tip the dough onto the surface and roll out to about a 2.3cm thickness. You don't want the muffins to be too thick or they will overcook on the outside before cooking properly within. Use an 8.5cm plain cutter to stamp out 8 rounds. Put these on the prepared tray and sprinkle the tops with a little semolina. Place each tray in a large, clean plastic bag and leave to prove for about an hour, or until risen slightly. Remove from the bags. Heat a heavy-based frying pan or griddle over a low heat. Wipe the surface with an oiled piece of scrunched-up kitchen paper. Cook the muffins, two at a time, for 5-6 minutes on each side until golden; wipe the pan with oiled kitchen paper as necessary between batches. Place the muffins on a wire rack and leave to cool completely. Slice in half and toast before serving with butter. BEGINNER'S BREAD 103 FRUIT DOUGHNUTS MAKES 20 I like to keep doughnuts simple, without fancy icing. This version uses three kinds of fresh fruit instead of jam and is slightly less sweetthan usual.

Add the milk and eggs and mix for about 8 minutes until smooth. Knead the dough on a slow speed for 5 minutes then add the butter, piece by piece, scraping down the side of the bowl from time to time. Once it is all incorporated and the dough is smooth and sticky, increase the speed and knead for a further 6 minutes. Tip the dough into a lightly greased large bowl, cover and refrigerate overnight. Turn out the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knock back by folding the dough inwards repeatedly to expel the air. Weigh the dough and divide it into 20 equal pieces (55-60g each). Roll each piece into a ball between the palms of your hands and flatten out a little. In the middle of each piece, place a couple of raspberries, a few blueberries or a few fig pieces. Form the dough into a ball around the fruit, making sure it is well sealed. Roll each one lightly but firmly into a smooth ball by placing it in a cage formed by your cupped hand on the work surface and moving your hand around in a circular motion. Place the balls on a lightly floured tray, cover loosely with cling film and leave to prove for an hour, or until doubled in size. When you are ready to cook, heat the oil in a deep-fryer, or a deep, heavy saucepan (no more than one-third full) to 180°C, or until a cube ofbread dropped in browns in a minute. You will need to cook the doughnuts 2 or 3 at a time. Gently lower them into the hot oil and fry, turning with tongs every few minutes to ensure they cook evenly. The doughnuts colour quickly, but need 10-12 minutes to cook through, when they'll puff up and float. Keep the oil at a constant temperature. Remove the doughnuts with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. Dredge with sugar while they are still hot and serve as soon as they are cool enough to eat. These doughnuts will keep for a day or two, but they are best eaten soon after they are cooked. BEGINNER'S BREAD 104 CHEESE CRACKERS MAKES 14 These spicy cheese crackers are gluten-free, a way ofbakingthatis much more in demand than when I started out, and so a useful recipe to have to hand. 75g strong Cheddar, finely grated 50g ground almonds 1 tbsp cornflour ~ tsp baking powder A pinch each of celery salt, garlic salt, paprika and white pepper (less than ~ tsp of each) 1 tsp Worcestershire sauce Y. tsp runny honey 2 tsp cold water Put the cheese, ground almonds, cornflour, baking powder and dry seasonings into a bowl and mix together. Add the Worcestershire sauce, honey and 1 tsp water. Squeeze and work the mixture until it comes together, adding the remaining water if required. You want the dough to be firm but malleable. Place the dough on a large sheet ofbaking parchment paper on your work surface and press it out into a rectangle, of even thickness. Place another sheet of parchment on top. Roll out the dough between the parchment until it is about16 x 27cm and 2-3mm thick. Remove the top piece of parchment and mark the dough into 14 rectangles with a knife, without cutting right through. Lift the dough on its sheet of parchment onto a baking tray and place in the fridge to rest for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 170°C/Gas 3 Y.. Bake for 12-15 minutes, until the crackers are turning brown. Take out the tray and lower the oven setting to 100°C/Gas 't:t. While the crackers are still hot, cut along the marked lines to separate them. Once the oven has cooled to the correct temperature, return the tray to the oven for 10 minutes to dry out the crackers a little. Transfer the crackers to a wire rack and leave to cool completely. Store in an airtight container. BEGINNER'S BREAD 106 LAVROCHE MAKES 30 Lavroche is a crisp wafer bread that's great with cheese at the end of a meal, or served with pre-dinner drinks, on its own or with a spread or a dip such as hummus. When I used to do big batches in hotel bakeries, we would make it in massive sheets that you'd pass through a rolling machine, but at home you can use a rolling pin to do the same job. 190g strong white bread flour 75gfine semolina ltsp fine salt ltbsp olive oil About 75ml water 40mlmilk 1 medium egg, beaten, to glaze 1 tbsp linseeds (also known as flaxseed) lOg Gruyere, finely grated lOg Parmesan, finely grated 1 tsp fennel seeds 1 tsp caraway seeds Put the flour, semolina and salt into a bowl and stir to combine. Add the olive oil, water and milk and mix to bring the ingredients together. Add a little more water if necessary; you want the mixture to be dry but pliable. Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it for 5 minutes until smooth. Wrap in cling film and leave to rest in the fridge for 30 minutes. Line two baking trays with baking parchment. Roll the dough out on a lightly floured surface to a very thin square, about 35 x 35cm. Brush off any excess flour. Trim the edges of the dough to neaten then cut into 3 strips, each about 30 x 9cm. Brush the dough strips with beaten egg. Coat one with linseeds, another with the grated cheeses and the third with the fennel and caraway seeds. Cut each strip of dough into 10 small triangles. Place the triangles on the prepared baking trays and rest in the fridge for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 220°C/Gas 7. Bake the lavroche triangles for about 15 minutes until they are crisp and browned. BEGINNER'S BREAD 109 ·n,. h~'l ·r ,r ,,. '\"''r ,\\t\\l'rt' '' 'h'•' . \\ •n\\l . . I HOTEL SECRETS . ... . . ·.. .. ' '' . .. / ,; / , / , . •• ,------------------------------------------------------·---· AS A TEENAGER, I WAS LUCKY enoughtogowithmydad to some good restaurants. It was at the Chester Grosvenor that I first saw a bread trolley in a Michelin-starred restaurant. I thought: this is interesting. And I also thought: the bread's okay, but it could be better. At the age of twenty-one, I finished working for my dad and applied for a job at the Chester Grosvenor. It's a city centre hotel in a Grade lllisted, black-and-white timbered building. Beautifully decorated inside, you always feel you are somewhere really special there. As a hotel baker, I learnt a whole new range of skills and recipes. My ingredients were more expensive, I had more time and I could experiment. There were all these dainty little things that you might find in a Paris patisserie - so easy to eat and gorgeous. Before working there, I'd never made Danish pastries or croissants- there was little call for croissants in a high -street bakery in the early eighties; if you wanted to eat croissants, you went to France. The head baker taught me his recipes before he left and I've refined them over the years, partly by working with other French pastry chefs, and partly in order to make them more accessible for the home baker. The main lesson I learnt is that a little effort can make a great difference, whether it's a plate of scones or a refined French tart. Working in high-street bakeries, you'd say, 'That'll do' and get away with it. But in hotels, everything has to be consistent and everything has to look perfect. In a normal bakery, when you make scones, say, they are probably 2-3 inches high- quite lumpy scones- because people want to get value for their money. But in a hotel, that's not the case; they want finesse. One of the keys to a smart afternoon tea is keeping everything the same size. That was always critical- from the sandwiches to FIVE-STAR BAKING 112 I the scone to the petits fours, barquettes and meringues. Quality and presentation matter. Scones are easy to make so it's what you serve them with - good jam, butter, cream and tea- that sets a scone apart. The standards in a hotel kitchen are rigorous. Each day, the executive chef would get the least successful breakfast dishes put onto a plate and brought into his office. If anything wasn't good enough, he'd call me in, as head baker. I'd be criticised if a roll was a touch more tanned or if a Danish pastry was slightly raw. It tended to happen because some of the ovens weren't the best, but everything had to be perfect and you couldn't just blame your tools. At the Grosvenor, I nearly gave up my baking career. I said to the chef, 'I'm alright at baking but I've been doing it for years and I want to be a chef.' So he moved me into hors d'oeuvres, then veg, then sauces, and finally mise en place, where you plate up the food. I did that for many months, moving around the kitchen and learning from the chefs and sous-chefs. I learnt to butcher the meat, to gut and prepare a fish. The chef wanted to make the most of my baking skills, so I ended up doing two jobs for a while and working a twelve-hour day. Finally, I said, 'I want to give up the baking and become a full-time chef.' Then he told me the salary. No chance. I went back to full-time baking. However, the experience of working as a cheffor a while gave my baking another dimension. I learnt knife skills that helped me to prepare ingredients for breads and pastries, and it really opened up the world offood, introducing me to flavours and textures I had never encountered before. I would find myself thinking that I could use this or that ingredient in a loaf or on top of a cake, and that became part of my craft. Cooking and baking are different skills but there's a crossover between them that helps a baker to be more creative. FIVE-STAR BAKING 113 ~-------- -- --- -- - - -- -- Next came London. At the age of twenty-four, I became the youngest head baker the Dorchester Hotel had ever had. It's one of the most prestigious five-star hotels in the world, in the centre ofLondon by Hyde Park, and guests come from all over the world to enjoy its thirties' glamour. The staff had a separate entrance down Deanery Street. You'd scan your card and go down to a beautiful kitchen the size of five tennis courts, with the latest equipment, and all of us in brand new uniforms. I'd work ten days and have only two or three days off. I couldn't go back home all that much and I missed my friends and family. In the end I thought: 'London's not for me.' I went up North again, to work at the Chester Grosvenor for another two years. The final chapter in my hotel years came when I worked at Cliveden. This was after I'd been working abroad in Cyprus for six years and it was a return that took me to the heart of the English countryside. You'd swear you were in the middle of nowhere but in fact you are only half an hour's drive from London. As you turn into this gravel drive you see one of the most beautiful stately homes in the country; it's been in many, many films. Ittakes a good five minutes to get to the top of the drive, and when you step into the hotel's grand hallway you'll be greeted by a suit of armour, tapestries on the walls and a huge formal staircase. But the thing I love about Cliveden is that it's still like being in someone's home, and you feel as though you should be there. There was a big snooker room down in the cellar, next to the bakery. I'd go in there when I was in between bakes, or when things were proving, and my snooker improved vastly. The place was beautiful but I have to say that it was also quite creepy at night when I was up baking and everyone else was asleep- I probably looked like a ghost, covered in white flour. Looking back, why did I make the move from the high street to hotel baking? Why did I go for the job ofhead baker at the FIVE-STAR BAKING 115 Dorchester when I reached the age of twenty-four? It's always the challenge. I knew that ifl didn't go for a job, I'd kick myselflater. Stretch yourself, and you become a better baker. Some of the recipes in this chapter are straightforward but have small touches that make them 'five star'. Others are more complex, such as the seasonal Danish pastries on page 118 and the ham and cheese croissants on page 156. These require time and attention but I'd encourage any baker to give them a go. If you can make a bread, you can make a croissant dough. On paper, the recipe seems to go on for ever and ever. But when you break it down, it's not hard. It's really just dough, with layers of butter in between -that's it. Use a good French butter and that will make all the difference. If you choose a high -quality butter and take your time with the folding, you'll end up with something that's up to professional standards. If you push yourself, you'll always find that actually it's not that difficult. Shortcrust pastry is also a matter of practice. It's key to get the fat and sugar to a fine crumb, before adding your egg yolk or water. Once the liquid goes in, mix it together with your hands, pushing and binding it together gently. Don't be tempted to add more liquid, as you'll knead the mixture too much and make it rubbery. Bring the dough together, wrap it in cling film and rest in the fridge for 30 minutes or so. If you make the pastry well ahead, you'll need to let it soften a little at room temperature before using it, or you'll struggle to roll it out without cracking. You can also roll your pastry out between a couple of sheets ofbaking parchment or cling film to stop it sticking to the work surface. If you stretch yourself then you'll always enjoy the rewards. As well as the satisfaction of making something well, you have much more control over what you're eating. Many commercial croissants and pastries use margarine rather than butter as the fat, for example. Bake them yourself and you know what goes into them. That way you'll be eating the best. FIVE-STAR BAKING 116 SEASONAL DANISH PASTRIES MAKES 15 Danish pastry dough is versatile and can be used to make all kinds of breakfast pastries. To achieve the layering of the dough and butter takes time -around 12 hours of chilling between folding and rolling- but the hands-on work isn't laborious. These luxurious pastries are filled with raspberries but you can use other fruits that suit the season- blackberries or apple for autumn, apricots in the summer, or even bananas all year round. For the dough 450gstrongwhite bread flour, plus extra for dusting 7g instant dried yeast 7gfine salt 75g caster sugar 2 medium eggs 75ml cold water 100ml whole milk 225g unsalted butter (ideally a good-quality Normandy butter), softened For the creme patissiere 250ml whole milk 1 vanilla pod, split lengthways 2 medium egg yolks 50g caster sugar 1 Y. tbsp cornflour 20gunsalted butter, cut into small dice To assemble 1 egg, beaten, to glaze 150g raspberries 75g apricot jam, to finish Put the flour into a food mixer fitted with the dough hook. Add the yeast to one side and the salt and sugar to the other and begin mixing on a slow speed. Add the eggs, water and milk and mix for a couple of minutes to bring the dough together. Increase the speed and mix for a further 5 minutes. (You can make this dough by hand but I would recommend using a mixer if possible.) Tip the dough onto a lightly floured surface and form into a ball. Wrap in cling film and rest in the fridge for 1 hour. Press the dough out on a lightly floured surface with your knuckles, then stretch to a rough rectangle. Now roll out to a smooth rectangle, 45 x 20cm, to end up with a short side facing you. The dough can be quite hard to stretch because it wants to pull back into shape; one tip is to press the sides down onto the work surface to help hold the dough as you roll. Spread the butter out to cover the bottom two-thirds of the dough; make sure it is in an even layer and comes almost to the edges. Fold the exposed dough down to cover half of the butter. Fold the bottom half of the buttered dough up and over, then seal the dough by gently squeezing the edges together. Wrap in cling film and refrigerate for at least an hour, until the butter has hardened. Unwrap the chilled dough, place it on a lightly floured surface and roll again into a rectangle, 45 x 20cm, with a short side facing you. Fold the bottom third of the dough up and the top third down on top. This is called 'a single turn'. Wrap the dough in cling film and place in the fridge for an hour. Repeat this stage twice more, chilling the dough between turns. Write the number ofturns on the cling film with a marker pen, as a reminder. Continued overleaf FIVE-STAR BAKING 118 Your dough now needs to be wrapped in cling film and chilled for at least 8 hours, or overnight, to rest and rise slightly. To make the creme patissiere, pour the milk into a saucepan. Scrape out the seeds from the vanilla pod and add them to the milk with the empty pod. Slowly bring to the boil. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, beat the egg yolks with the sugar and cornflour. A15 soon as the milk comes to the boil, remove the vanilla pod and pour the milk onto the egg mix, whisking as you do so. Pour back into the pan and heat gently, stirring all the time, until the custard thickens. Pour the creme patissiere into a clean bowl and stir in the butter. Cover the surface closely with cling film to prevent a skin forming and leave to cool, then place in the fridge. Line three baking trays with baking parchment. Unwrap the chilled dough and roll out on a lightly floured surface to a 35cm square. Trim the edges to straighten. Cut the dough into 15 strips, flouring the knife from time to time to stop it sticking. Twist each strip in opposite directions from both ends and tie in a knot then tuck the ends under to form a circle. Place the pastries on the prepared baking trays, leaving enough space in between for them to expand. Put each tray inside a large, clean plastic bag and leave to prove for 2 hours, or until doubled in size. Heat your oven to 200°C/ Gas 6. Take the trays out of the bags. Gently ease open the centre of each knot to make more space and put a spoonful of creme patissiere in the middle. Brush the pastries with beaten egg to glaze and bake for 15-20 minutes, until risen and golden. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. Before serving, place the fruit on top of the creme patissiere. Warm the apricot jam and brush on the pastries to give them a final glaze.

Repeat this stage twice more, chilling the dough between turns. Write the number of turns on the cling film with a marker pen, as a reminder. Your dough now needs to be wrapped in cling film and chilled for at least 8 hours, or overnight, to rest and rise slightly. Line two baking trays with baking parchment. Unwrap the chilled dough and roll it out on a lightly floured surface to a rectangle, 60 x 30cm. Trim the edges to straighten. Cover the surface of the dough with chocolate spread, leaving about a lcm clear margin along the edges. Fold the dough in halflengthways, to make a rectangle 60 x 15cm. Cut the dough into 6long strips, each 2.5cm wide, flouring the knife from time to time to stop it sticking. Twist each strip in opposite directions from both ends and tie in a knot then tuck the ends under to form a circle. Place the pastries on the prepared baking trays and put each tray inside a large, clean plastic bag. Leave to prove for 2 hours, or until the pastries have doubled in size. Heat your oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Take the baking trays out of the bags. Bake the pastries for 15-20 minutes, until risen and golden. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. Melt the white chocolate in aheatproofbowl over a pan ofbarely simmering water (the bottom of the bowl must not touch the water). Drizzle the melted white chocolate over the cooled pastries and leave to set before serving. Photograph overleaf SULTANA& PECAN SCONE RING MAKES 8 Scones are a hotel afternoon tea staple. Mine once got the approval of Queen Elizabeth, the Queen Mother, who used to come to Cliveden quite often and take tea in Madame de Pompadour's French dining room. I like to use strong bread flour in my scones and in this recipe I've slipped in some lard as well as butter, for a better texture and flavour- a tip I got from my nan. 225g strong white bread flour, plus an extra 25g for dusting ~ tsp fine salt 2 tsp baking powder 20g cold unsalted butter, cut into small dice 20g cold lard, cut into small dice 40g caster sugar 60g golden sultanas 20gpecan nuts, roughly chopped Finely grated zest of !orange lmediumegg 125m! whole milk 1 egg, beaten, to glaze Heat your oven to 220°C/Gas 7. Line a baking tray with baking parchment. Put the 225gflour into a large bowl with the salt and baking powder. Add the butter and lard and rub in with your fingertips until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Add the sugar, sultanas, chopped pecans and orange zest and stir to combine. Make a well in the centre and break in the egg. Pour in half of the milk then mix with a wooden spoon until smoothly combined. Mix in the remaining milk, a little at a time, until you have a soft dough- you may not need all of it. Dust your work surface with the 25gflour. Tip the dough onto it and gently fold it repeatedly until the flour is incorporated and the dough is smooth. If the dough is sticky, dust your hands with more flour to make it easier to handle. Shape the dough into a round, 2.5cm thick, and place on the prepared tray. Score the scone round into 8 triangles by cutting deeply into the dough until your knife touches the baking tray. Brush the top with beaten egg. Bake the scone round for 20 minutes, until risen and golden brown. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. Eat warm or cold, cut into 8 wedges, on the same day to enjoy at its best. FIVE-STAR BAKING 128 NICE BISCUITS MAKES 12 -1 5 I do like the classic biscuits and this is my version of one of the best. Thin, crisp and flavoured with coconut, these delicate biscuits are perfect withacuppa. 125gplain flour, plus extra for dusting lOg cold unsalted butter, cut into small dice 50g caster sugar 20g desiccated coconut ~ tsp baking powder 40- SOml milk ~ tsp vanilla extract 1-2 tsp granulated sugar, for sprinkling Put the flour into a large bowl, add the butter and rub in using your fingertips. Add the caster sugar, coconut and baking powder and mix to combine. Add 25rnl of the milk with the vanilla extract and use one hand to bring the mixture together. Add the remaining milk, 1 tsp at a time, until you have a stiff dough that forms a ball; you may not need all the milk or you may need a little more. Wrap in cling film and leave to rest in the fridge for at least 30 minutes. Line a baking tray with baking parchment. Lightlydustyourwork surface with flour and roll out the dough on it to a 3mm thickness. Using a Scm fluted square cutter, stamp out squares. (Alternatively, you could cut straight-sided biscuits using a sharp knife.) Place on the prepared tray, leaving a small space between each one. Re-roll any trimmings and stamp out more squares. Prick the surface of each square with a fork (this stops them rising too much). Place the tray in the fridge to chill for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 190°C/ Gas 5. Just before baking, sprinkle 1 tsp granulated sugar over the surface of the dough squares. Bake for 15 minutes, until the biscuits are pale golden brown and cooked through. Remove from the oven and leave on the tray to firm up for a few minutes then transfer to a wire rack to cool. Sprinkle with a little more sugar before serving, if you wish. FIVE-STAR BAKING 130 JAFFA CAKES MAKES 12 Children- and adults -love these Jaffa Cakes, which are made using a shallow bun tray as a mould. The orange is just that little bit more intense and you can use your choice of chocolate. It's a poshed up version of an all-time favourite, fit for a five-star hotel tea. For thespongebase Unsalted butter, for greasing 25g self-raising flour A pinch of fine salt Ys tsp baking powder !large egg, separated 25g caster sugar Ys tsp cream of tartar For the orange jelly Y. x135gpacketorangejelly 2 tsp orange marmalade 60ml boiling water For the chocolate topping lOOg dark chocolate (60- 70% cocoa solids) 40ml double cream 1 tbsp caster sugar Heat your oven to 180°C/Gas 4 and grease a shallow 12-hole bun tray with butter. For the sponge, sift the flour, salt and baking powder together; set aside. In a medium bowl, using a hand-held electric whisk, beat the egg yolk with half of the sugar until the mixture thickens and turns pale in colour- this will take about 5 minutes. Carefully fold in the flour mixture, using a large metal spoon or spatula. In a clean bowl, whisk the egg white with the cream of tartar until stiff. Gradually add the remaining sugar, whisking well after each addition, then gently fold into the whisked egg and sugar mixture. Divide the mixture evenly between the bun tray moulds and gently smooth the surface to level. Bake for 8- 10 minutes until the sponges are risen and spring back when lightly touched. Leave in the tray for a few minutes then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Wash and dry the bun tray then line the moulds with cling film. Break the jelly into cubes and cut into small pieces. Place in a jug with the marmalade, pour on the boiling water and stir until the jelly has dissolved. Divide between the lined moulds then refrigerate to set. For the topping, break the chocolate into pieces and put into a small pan with the cream and sugar. Warm gently over a low heat until melted. Stir to combine and form a thick silky sauce. Let cool slightly. To assemble, take the jellies from the moulds. For a neat finish, cut each jelly with a small round cutter. Sit each one, rounded side up, on a sponge base and spoon on the chocolate topping to coat. (This must not be too warm or it will melt the jelly layer and slide off. If necessary, let cool for a little longer.) Mark a decorative pattern in the chocolate using a cocktail stick or skewer. Leave to set on a wire rack. FIVE-STAR BAKING 133 FIG ROLLS MA KES 14 An afternoon tea is a great pick-me-up and can be made into a special treat just with a welcome pot of tea and a little plate ofhome-made biscuits like these. You can vary the spices and citrus zest to your taste, and the grated apple adds a little freshness to the dried fruits. For the pastry 200g plain flour Y, tsp baking powder 120g cold unsalted butter, diced A pinch of fine salt 1 tbsp caster sugar 1 medium egg, lightly beaten For the filling 175g dried figs, roughly chopped 50g dates, roughly chopped 75mlwater '!. tsp bicarbonate of soda Finely grated zest and juice of1orange Finely grated zest ofllemon 25g dark muscovado sugar 1 small apple, peeled and coarsely grated % tsp ground cinnamon % tsp freshly grated nutmeg To make the pastry, mix the flour and baking powder together in a large bowl. Add the butter and rub in with your fingertips until the mixture resemble fine breadcrumbs. Add the salt and sugar and mix well. Add the egg and bring the mixture together to form a soft dough. Transfer to a lightly floured surface and gently knead into a smooth ball. Wrap in cling film and place in the fridge to rest. For the filling, put the figs and dates into a small pan with the water, bicarbonate of soda, orange zest and juice, lemon zest and sugar. Heat gently until bubbling and simmer until thick, sticky andjam-like. Set aside to cool, then add the grated apple and spices and mix well. Heat your oven to 190°C/ Gas 5 and line abakingtraywith baking parchment. Roll out the rested pastry on a lightly floured surface to a rectangle, 32 x 25cm and 5mm thick. Trim the edges to straighten. Cut the pastry in half so you have two 30cm long strips. Turn one piece of pastry so the long side is facing you. Spoon half of the sticky fruit filling in a line along this pastry strip, towards the edge closest to you but leaving a lcm clear margin. Brush this pastry edge with water, then bring the other side of the pastry up over the filling and press the edges together to seal. Trim the ends to neaten. Repeat with the remaining strip of pastry, using the rest of the filling. Carefully lift the filled rolls onto the prepared baking tray and score at 4cm intervals, taking care not to cut right through the pastry. Press a fork down onto the top of each roll to mark it and slightly flatten to the classic fig roll shape. Bake for 15-20 minutes, until golden. Leave to cool on the tray for 5 minutes, then cut along the scored marks and transfer the fig rolls to a wire rack to cool completely. FIVE-STAR BAKING 134 CHOCOLATE & ORANGE MINI TARTS MAKES 8 The flavour of the orange really comes through in these special little tarts. Because the chocolate is so rich, you don't want too much so I've made them small enough to eat in a couple ofbites. The gold leaf decoration is a five-star hotel touch but I'd be equally happy with just the chocolate curls, or even a halved fresh orange segment brushed with a bit of apricot jam! For the pastry 100g unsalted butter, softened 50g icing sugar 1 medium egg, beaten 125gplain flour Finely grated zest of 1orange For the filling llOg dark chocolate ( 60-70% cocoa solids) Finely grated zest of 1orange 1 tsp orange blossom water 100ml double cream 20gunsalted butter To decorate 75g dark chocolate ( 60-70% cocoa solids) 1 small sheet edible gold leaf (optional) To make the pastry, beat the butter and icing sugar together in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Gradually incorporate the beaten egg, then add the flour and orange zest and stir until just combined; try not to over-mix. The dough will be very soft at this stage. Form it into a ball, wrap in cling film and chill in the fridge for at least an hour. Heat your oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Have ready 8 fluted mini tarts tins, 6.5cm in diameter and 2cm deep. (Alternatively, you could use a shallow 12-hole bun tray and make 12 slightly smaller tarts.) Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface to a 3mm thickness and cut out 8 rounds, using a 10.5cm plain round cutter (or an Scm cutter if using a bun tray). Use to line the mini tart tins, making sure you push the pastry into the fluted edges; leave the excess overhanging the edges of the tins. Line each pastry case with a small square ofbakingparchment and fill with baking beans. Bake 'blind' for 8 minutes, until the pastry is dry to the touch, then remove the parchment and beans and return the pastry cases to the oven for about 4 minutes until the base is dry and the pastry is very lightly coloured. Let cool, then use a small, sharp knife to trim away the excess pastry from the edge of the tins. Melt 20g of the chocolate (for the filling) in aheatproofbowl over a pan of simmering water, making sure the bottom of the bowl doesn't touch the water. Brush the base of the tarts with the melted chocolate. Leave to set. For the filling, chop the remaining 90g dark chocolate into small pieces with a large knife, or in a food processor, and place in a bowl FIVE-STAR BAKING 136 • • • 0 .. with the orange zest. Put the orange blossom water, cream and butter into a pan and heat sl,owly until the mixture just comes to the boil. Pour onto the choc.olate and stir until it melts to form a smooth, shiny paste. Spoon the filling into the mini tart cases and leave to set (at room temperature). To make the chocolate curls, break the 75g dark chocolate into small pieces and melt in a heatproofbowl over a pan of simmering water (as before), stirring occasionally until smooth. Pour the chocolate onto the centre of a clean baking sheet and use a palette knife to spread it out into a smooth, thin layer. Place in the fridge for about 5-10 minutes, until set but not brittle. Press gently with your fingertip -it should leave a mark but not an indentation. Use the edge of a large, sharp knife to scrape the chocolate away from you: it should curl. If it breaks, the chocolate is too cold so leave it to soften on the work surface for a few minutes then try again. Store the chocolate curls in an airtight box between layers ofbaking parchment until required. (You will have more than you need, but the excess can be frozen.) Before serving, decorate each mini chocolate and orange tart with a few chocolate curls and a little crumpled gold leaf, if you like.

The trick is to whip the meringue properly, so it can hold the nuts well even when they release some of their oils. These meringue fingers are piped, baked, then sandwiched with cream and decorated with chocolate and toasted almonds. In a luxury hotel such as the Grosvenor, they would have been piped perfectly, of course. 4 medium egg whites ){ tsp cream of tartar 170g caster sugar 75g ground almonds 1 tbsp cornflour For the filling and decoration 75g dark chocolate (60-70% cocoa solids), cut into small pieces . 400ml double cream 50gchoppedtoasted almonds Heat your oven to 140°C/Gas 1 and line two baking trays with baking parchment. In a clean bowl, whisk the egg whites with the cream of tartar until stiff. Gradually add 120g of the sugar, a spoonful at a time, whisking well between each addition until you have a thick, glossy meringue. In a small bowl, mix together the remaining 50g caster sugar, ground almonds and cornflour. Gradually and carefully fold this into the meringue, until evenly combined. Put the mixture into a piping bag fitted with a lcm star nozzle and pipe 24 fingers, about 9cm long and 3cm wide, onto the prepared baking trays. Bake for 20 minutes, then turn off the oven and leave the meringues inside for a couple ofhours until they are set and cooled. For the decoration, put the chocolate into a heatproofbowl set over a pan of gently simmering water, making sure the bottom of the bowl doesn't touch the water, and leave until melted and smooth. For the filling, whip the cream until it is fairly stiffbut still easy to pipe, and place in a piping bag fitted with a large plain nozzle. Place pairs of meringues side-by-side, fiat-side up, to form a V-shape. Pipe cream between the meringues to sandwich them together. Scatter chopped nuts over the cream filling and drizzle the melted chocolate decoratively over the meringues to finish. FIVE-STAR BAKING 141 INDIVIDUAL LEMON MERINGUE PIES MAKES 4 The French have dominated high-end baking because of the finesse of their patisserie. But I think that's wrong! Here's a recipe for a British classic, made on a smaller scale so you can eat it for tea or as a dessert. Take a little bit of care and it will look and taste great. You will have more lemon curd than you need- keep the rest in the fridge in a sealed jar to use as you like- to fill tartlet cases, top pancakes, spread on wholemeal bread etc. ------------------------~-------·----~~----,~------~ .... ~~~---------------- For the base 150g gingernut biscuits 75g unsalted butter, melted For the filling Finely grated zest of 3lemons Juice of6large lemons 50mlwater 2 tbsp cornflour 175g caster sugar 3large egg yolks 25g unsalted butter For the meringue 3large egg whites 175g caster sugar 1 tsp cornflour Crush the ginger biscuits to fine crumbs in a food processor (or use a rolling pin to smash them in a plastic bag) and mix with the melted butter. Divide between four individual10cm loose-based tart tins, 3cm deep, and press the mixture onto the base and sides to line them. Place in the fridge to set. For the filling, put the lemon zest and juice, water, cornflour, sugar and egg yolks in a small heavy-based saucepan. Heat gently, stirring continuously, until the mixture thickens. Be patient, as this will take 10-15 minutes. Stir in the butter to make a thick, glossy lemon curd. Spoon a layer over the biscuit bases and leave to cool. (Keep the rest of the lemon curd in a sealed jar in the fridge to use as required.) Heat your oven to 190°C/Gas 5. Whisk the egg whites in a large, clean bowl until stiff, then add the sugar a spoonful at a time, whisking well between each addition, until you have a thick, glossy meringue. Fold in the cornflour, using a large metal spoon or spatula. Spoon or pipe the meringue generously over the lemon layer and bake for 15 minutes, until the meringue is lightly browned on top. Serve hot, warm or cold, with pouring cream. FIVE - STAR BAKING 142 PRUNE & ARMAGNAC TART SERVE S 8 This is a great tart and the Armagnac's the killer ingredient- it brings a special quality to the flavour. Here I've made a large tart to cut up and share out for afternoon tea or dessert but you can make individual tarts, or bake it in along tranche tin to slice into fingers if you prefer. For the pastry 200g plain flour, plus extra for dusting 2 tbsp icing sugar lOOg cold unsalted butter, cut into small dice !medium egg 1 tsp lemon juice 2-3 tsp cold water For the prunes 175g dried prunes (ideally Agen) 3 tbsp Armagnac (or other brandy) For the filling lOOg unsalted butter, softened lOOg caster sugar 2 largeeggs 50g plain flour 75g ground almonds lOOgplumjam 20g flaked almonds For the glaze 50g caster sugar For the pastry, mix the flour and icing sugar together in a large bowl and rub in the butter with your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Mix the egg with the lemon juice and 2 tsp water, then stir into the rubbed-in mixture, using a table knife. Add the extra 1 tsp water to bring the dough together if necessary. Gently knead the dough into a smooth ball, wrap in cling film and chill for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, in a small bowl, soak the prunes in the Armagnac. Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface to a 30cm circle and use to line a 23cm loose-based tart tin, 3.5cm deep, leaving a little excess overhanging the edge. Prick the base with a fork, then chill in the fridge for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Line the pastry case with baking parchment and fill with baking beans. Bake 'blind' for 12-15 minutes, until the pastry is dry to the touch, then remove the paper and beans and return the pastry case to the oven for 5 minutes, until the base is dry and the pastry is lightly coloured. Use a small knife to trim away the excess from the edge. To make the almond filling, beat the butter and sugar together in a bowl until light and fluffy, then beat in the eggs, one at a time. Stir in the flour and ground almonds. Spread the jam over the base of the pastry case. Spoon the almond filling on top and spread to level. Drain the prunes, reserving the juice. Carefully press the prunes into the almond mixture and scatter the flaked almonds on top. Bake for 25-30 minutes, until the filling is risen and golden. For the glaze, in a small pan, heat the reserved prune soaking liquor with the 50g caster sugar. Bring to the boil and let bubble to reduce until it thickens. Brush the surface of the tart with the syrup. Serve warm or at room temperature, with creme fraiche or cream.

For the apricots, put the sugar and liqueur into a saucepan. Bring to the boil, then lower the heat and simmer for 5 minutes. Place the apricot wedges in the syrup and remove from the heat. Leave to cool. To make the batter, in a bowl or large jug, whisk together the whole eggs, extra yolks, sugar, salt and flour. Add the cream, milk and lemon zest and whisk again until evenly combined. Leave to stand for about 30 minutes. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 160°C/Gas 3. Drain the apricots and place them in a shallow ovenproof dish, about 25 x 17cm (saving the syrup for poaching or eating with other fruit). Pour the batter over the apricots and bake for 20-25 minutes, until risen, golden and just set. Scatter over the flaked almonds, dust with icing sugar and serve straight away. FIVE-STAR BAKING 147 ' A LEMON BRIOCHE A TETE MAKES 1 LARGE BRIOCHE A brioche is one of those classic French bakes you have to learn when you're working in a smart hotel. This brioche is shaped so it has a tete, or head. One of the difficulties is to keep this bobble balanced. The trick is not to make the top part too heavy or it will crush the lower one. There's also a special technique in this recipe for joining the two balls together in a way that keeps the tete right on top. You will need to allow plenty of time for the long, slow rise. 350g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting 7g instant dried yeast 5gfine salt 35g caster sugar About lOOml warm whole milk 3 medium eggs Finely grated zest of1lemon 170g unsalted butter (ideally a good-quality Normandy butter), cut into small pieces, softened, plus extra for greasing Egg wash (1 egg, lightly beaten with a little milk), to glaze For the filling and glaze 2 tbsp apricot jam 2 tbsp pearl sugar 200g lemon curd As this is a wet dough with lots ofbutter, I'd highly recommend using a food mixer if possible. Put the flour into a food mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Add the yeast to one side of the bowl and the salt and sugar to the other. Now add the milk, eggs and lemon zest and mix on a slow speed for 2 minutes, then on a medium speed for a further 6-8 minutes until you have a soft, glossy, elastic dough. Add the butter pieces and continue to mix for a further 4-5 minutes, scraping down the bowl periodically to ensure that the butter is fully incorporated. The dough will be very soft. Tip the dough into a plastic bowl, cover with cling film and chill for at least 7 hours, or overnight, until it has firmed up and you are able to shape it. Grease a 22cm brioche tin with butter. Take the brioche dough from the fridge. Tip it onto a lightly floured surface and fold it in on itself a few times to knock out the air. Tear off a piece of the dough (about 125g in weight) and shape it into a smooth ball by placing it in a cage formed by your cupped hand on the work surface and moving your hand around in a circular motion, rotating the ball rapidly. Take the larger piece of dough and form it into a smooth, tight ball by cupping it with the sides of your hands and turning it around to create a smooth ball. Press gently to flatten slightly. Continued overleaf FIVE-STAR BAKING 148 I J Dust your middle finger and forefinger with flour and push them through the centre of the larger ball of dough to make a hole (or use the end of a wooden spoon). Now stretch the hole so the ball looks like a tall ring doughnut. Shape the smaller ball into a cylinder and taper one end. Using a knife, slice the bottom half of the tapered end vertically in two, keeping the top half intact. Pull the two ends apart then insert these tapered ends through the hole in the large ball and tuck them outwards underneath the large ball. Form the top of the cylinder into a ball. (This technique keeps the small ball of dough in place when it's baked, otherwise it can tip to the side and won't stay in the middle.) Push the handle of a wooden spoon down through both balls right to the base. This will help the brioche to cook all the way through. Place the brioche in the prepared tin and stand it on a baking tray. Place inside a large, clean plastic bag and leave to prove for 2-3 hours, or until doubled in size. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 190°C/Gas 5. Remove the tray from the plastic bag. Brush the brioche with egg wash and bake for 25- 30 minutes, until risen and golden brown. Note that the sugar and butter will make the brioche colour before it is fully baked. To check it is cooked, carefully tip the brioche out of its tin and tap the bottom: it should sound hollow. If not, return it to the tin and bake for a further 5 minutes. But keep a close eye- if you overcook the brioche, it will become dry. Leave the brioche in its tin for 5 minutes. Meanwhile, gently heat the apricot jam with a little water, then press through a sieve. Brush the top of the brioche with the apricot glaze and sprinkle with the pearl sugar. Remove the brioche from the tin and place on a wire rack. Leave to cool. Spoon the lemon curd into a piping bag fitted with a bismarck nozzle (for filling doughnuts) and inject the brioche from the top with the lemon curd to fill the centre with it. Cut into wedges to serve. FIVE-STAR BAKING 150 SALMON IN BRIOCHE SERVES 4 This is one of the dishes I created at the Dorchester for our special guests. The combination oftastes and textures is amazing: the crispness of the crust on the outside, the softness of the brioche beneath and the gorgeous salmon with a hint of dill in the middle. Allow plenty of time for the lengthy, slow rise. For the dough 375gstrongwhite bread flour 7ginstantdriedyeast 7gfinesalt 3 tbsp caster sugar 5tbspmilk 3 medium eggs 185g unsalted butter (ideally a good -quality Normandy butter), cut into small pieces, softened 1 medium egg, beaten, to glaze For the filling 4 sprigs of dill 4 salmon fillets (about 175g each), skinned and pin-boned Finely grated zest of llemon Salt Put the flour into a food mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and add the yeast to one side and the salt and sugar to the other. Now add the milk and eggs and mix on a medium speed for about 8 minutes until smooth. (If you don't have a freestanding mixer, use a hand-held mixer fitted with dough hooks- the dough is too loose to knead easily by hand.) With the motor running, gradually add the butter pieces, scraping down the bowl periodically. Once all the butter is incorporated and the dough is smooth and sticky, increase the speed and knead for a further 6 minutes. Tip the dough into a large bowl (it will almost double in size), cover with cling film and place in the fridge overnight, or for at least 7 hours. Heat your oven to 200°C/ Gas 6 and line a baking tray with baking parchment. Tip the brioche dough out onto a lightly floured surface and roll out to a 36cm square, about 5mm thick. Cut into 4 even squares. Place a sprig of dill in the centre of each square and sit a portion of salmon on top. Season the salmon lightly with salt and sprinkle with a little lemon zest. Brush the edges of the pastry with beaten egg. Enclose the salmon in the pastry by bringing the two sides along the length of each fillet together and sealing, then folding the two ends up and over. Trim away any excess pastry so it isn't thick where the seams join. (If the pastry is too thick, the fish won't cook properly.) Carefully turn the parcels over and very lightly score the pastry to mark a criss-cross pattern. Brush the surface with more beaten egg and bake the parcels in the oven for 15-20 minutes, or until golden brown. Serve hot or warm. FIVE·STAR BAKING 153 PEA, PANCETTA & PARMESAN TART SERVES 6 This is a lovely, light, refreshing summer tart that is perfect for a more substantial but refined savoury tea. Little chunks of salty pancetta sit alongside sweet peas within a Parmesan and lemon flavoured custard. For the pastry 225gplain flour, plus extra for dusting A pinch of fine salt 60g cold unsalted butter, cut into small dice 60g cold lard, cut into small dice 3-5 tbsp ice-cold water For the filling 195g pancetta, cut into 5-6mmdice Y. red onion, finely diced 5 medium eggs, plus an extra 3 egg yolks 200ml double cream 75g Parmesan, finely grated A pinch of white pepper A pinch of fine salt lOOg ricotta lOOg frozen peas Finely grated zest ofllemon To make the pastry, mix the flour and salt together in a bowl, add the butter and lard and rub in lightly with your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Gradually add the water and mix until the dough begins to come together. Gently knead into a smooth ball, wrap in cling film and chill for at least 30 minutes. Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface to a 3mm thickness and use to line a 25cm loose-based round tart tin, 3.5cm deep, leaving a little excess overhanging the edge. Prick the base all over with a fork, then chill for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Line the pastry case with baking parchment and fill with baking beans. Bake 'blind' for 12-15 minutes, until the pastry is dry to the touch, then remove the paper and beans and return the pastry case to the oven for about 5 minutes, until the base is dry and the pastry is lightly coloured. Use a small, sharp knife to trim away the excess pastry from the edge. Lower the oven setting to 180°C/ Gas 4. To make the filling, cook the pancetta in a dry frying pan over a medium heat until golden and the edges begin to crisp, then remove. Lower the heat under the pan slightly, add the red onion and cook gently in the pancetta fat until softened. In a bowl, beat the eggs, extra yolks and cream together until evenly combined. Add the grated Parmesan, pepper and a small pinch of salt (the pancetta and Parmesan are salty). Scatter the diced pancetta and onion in the pastry case. Dollop the ricotta in heaped teaspoonfuls over the top and scatter over the peas and lemon zest. Carefully pour in the creamy egg mixture. Bake for 35-45 minutes, until the filling is just set and golden. Leave in the tin for 5 minutes, then carefully unmould the tart. Serve warm or cold. FIVE-STAR BAKING 154 r------------------------------ HAM&CHEESE C OISSANTS MAKES 12 For a sensational brunch dish that everyone will remember, it really is worth making your own croissants. The recipe looks long but once you understand the process, it's just a matter of repeating stages that don't take much time. A croissant is all about the layers. Make sure you chill the dough well and roll it out to exactly the same level each time so you don't get more butter in some parts and end up with bread rather than a properly flaky croissant. You'll need to allow around 20 hours in total for chilling the dough. 350g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting 150g plain flour lOg instant dried yeast lOg fine salt 80g caster sugar 280mlwater 300g unsalted butter (ideally a good-quality Normandy butter), softened 120g ham, thinly sliced 200gmature Cheddar, grated 1 egg, beaten, to glaze Put both flours into a food mixer fitted with the dough hook. Add the yeast to one side and the salt and sugar to the other an,d begin mixing on a slow speed. Add the water and mix for a couple of minutes to bring the dough together. Increase the speed and mix for a further 6 minutes. The dough should be fairly stiff. (You can make this dough by hand but I'd recommend using a mixer if possible.) Lift the dough onto a lightly floured surface and form into a ball. Put into a greased bowl, cover with cling film and leave to rest in the fridge for atleast 8 hours, or overnight. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface to a rectangle, 60 x 20cm, to end up with a short side facing you. The dough can be quite hard to stretch because it wants to pull back into shape; one tip is to press the sides down onto the work surface to help hold the dough as you roll. Spread the butter out to cover the bottom two-thirds of the dough; make sure it is in an even layer and comes almost to the edges. Fold the exposed dough down to cover half of the butter. Fold the bottom half of the buttered dough up and over, then seal the dough by gently squeezing the edges together. Wrap in cling film and refrigerate for at least an hour, until the butter has hardened. Unwrap the chilled dough, place it on a lightly floured surface and roll again into a rectangle, 45 x 20cm, with a short side facing you. Fold the bottom third of the dough up and the top third down on top. This is called 'a single turn'. Wrap the dough in cling film and place in the FIVE-STAR BAKING 156 fridge for an hour. Repeat this stage three more times, chilling the dough in between turns. Write the number of turns on the cling film with a mar kerpen, as a reminder. After the final tum, wrap the dough in cling film and chill for at least 8 hours, or overnight, to rest and rise slightly. When you are ready to shape the croissants, line two or three baking trays with baking parchment. Place the chilled dough on a lightly floured surface and roll into a rectangle, 42 x 30cm, with a short side facing you. Trim the edges to neaten. Cut the rectangle in two lengthways, then cut triangles along the length of each strip (a pizza wheelis a good tool for this job). The base of each triangle should be about 12cm wide and it should be about15cm high. You will get 6 triangles from each strip (you'll need to trim off a small triangular piece from each end). Cut the ham into pieces that are roughly the same size as the dough triangles. Place a piece of ham on each triangle and sprinkle over some grated cheese. Hold the wide base of the triangle and gently tug the pointed opposite end to cause slight tension in the dough. Starting at the thick end, roll up into a croissant shape. Place the croissants on the prepared trays, leaving space in between for them to expand. Place each tray in a large, clean plastic bag and leave to prove at room temperature for 2 hours, or until the croissants have doubled in size. (If you want to make these in advance, wrap each croissant in cling film before it proves, and freeze. Thaw and prove in the morning for a mid-morning brunch.) Heat your oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Take the trays of croissants out of the bags. Just before baking, brush the croissants with egg wash. Bake for 15 minutes, then lower the oven setting to 180°C/Gas 4 and bake for a further 5 minutes, until risen and golden. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. The croissants are best eaten warm.

The bakes of other countries expand your repertoire. In recent years, the range of ingredients available in this country has exploded, making exotic recipes much more accessible. Most of what you need can be found in supermarkets and delis, or else is easily available online. My travels in baking really began in my late twenties, when I was approached about working as a head baker for a hotel in Cyprus. The guests at the time were mainly from Europe and the hotel needed someone to show the Cypriot guys how European baking worked. Most bakers who went out there stayed six months. I fell in love with the place and stayed for six years. Going to Cyprus was a massive change from life in the north ofEngland. It was very hot in the bakery so we just wore shorts. I got on with the lifestyle and the people, and I made a lot of new friends. Most importantly, I met my wife Alex out there- she was working in the hotel- and we got married in the oldest Christian church on the island. The hotel where I worked is called the Annabelle and it's like something out of a dream: swimming pools, the view of the sea, the heat. Even in winter, it's 25°C when the sun's out. I soon started to pick up the Cypriot way ofbaking. They still make bread at home in the beehive ovens you see all over the island; every family has one in the garden. They're like the outdoor ovens you find in Italy, with an arched opening and a domed interior. They fire the oven up with loads of wood and once the brick starts turning white, you push the wood and ash to one side, mop it out, get a big bunch of oregano tied to a stick and brush the inside of the oven, so the herbs infuse the oven and all your breads. Cypriot families get together on a Sunday- the teenagers, the grandparents, everyone. They might work in the city but BAKES OF THE WORLD 162 I t • I • I • at the weekend they go back to their village to see their yay as - grandmothers- and their mothers. It's all about food, and bread baked in the oven is the centre of that. Like olives, halloumi and feta, it's a celebration of their area. Cyprus has got a Greek aspect, obviously, but it also has a great influence from the Middle East. When I lived in Cyprus, it wasn't part of the EU and I had to leave the country every six months to go and get a stamp on my visa, so I did a lot of travelling in the Middle East, finding out about different ways ofbaking. First I travelled to Jordan to check out their flatbreads. I remember going to the walled city of Petra and coming across a Bedouin woman squatting down on the ground next to a fire, making breads on a small metal dome. As she demonstrated how to make bread in this very basic way I realised that, essentially, nothing in this method had changed for thousands of years. Then I went to Egypt, and there I was fascinated by the tarts and puddings made with set milk or cream. They've often got mastika, or mastic, in there. This is a dried tree resin with the aniseed flavour that runs through many of the bakes in the Middle East, and also Cyprus, and it is one of the more unusual ingredients that I've included in this chapter. The ovens were similar to the ones in Cyprus, except a bit more square and longer, in order to get more into them. Being abroad is about digging around to discover why people eat what they do. In the Middle East, how do you bake when the temperatures are so extreme? You have to adapt your recipes to make them work. What flours do they have? The soils of the Middle East mean the flour is less strong- with less protein to make it rise- and so they make flatbreads . Because many people in the Middle East used to be nomadic, they didn't stay in one place for long enough to build an oven, and kept the bread-making pretty simple. When they did build ovens, they were more like furnaces than our Western ovens. BAKES OF THE WORLD 163 It's all about getting very high temperatures when it comes to flatbreads -the thinner the bread, the faster you want to cook it to stop it drying out. When I travel, I try flavours, I try techniques. I think about the bakes people ate historically and then see how that leads up to what they eat today. There are the differences between countries, and then there are the connections. Just look at the variations on the same ingredients: you think of fruit cake and hot cross buns in Britain but you also find fruited buns and loaves in Italy, France, Norway, Sweden. The methods have changed slightly but the basic recipe is instantly recognisable. Some of these connections go way back. Archaeologists have found sourdough spores in the large ceramic pots they used for bread-making in Ancient Egypt; this style ofbaking, so popular again these days, has long roots. Back in this country, London is one of the world's most important centres offood, thanks to the city's diversity and the huge number of chefs. It's a melting pot offood cultures and top-quality cooking- from Mexican to Indian to Middle Eastern. You can take all these flavour combinations into baking, both savoury and sweet. You can also learn different techniques, though they're not always easy. I once had a go at cooking naan bread in a tandoor in an Indian restaurant and nearly scalded my eyebrows off it was so hot! When I went to work in the Mediterranean, I fell in love with baking all over again. I still travel and bake today. You always discover another approach to food in other countries and different slants on the familiar- flavours, methods, proving, baking. It keeps you learning. BAKES OF THE WORLD 165 FIG&WALNUT BREAD STICKS MAKES 16 Simple to make, these are delicious eaten on their own. They also make a great accompaniment to blue cheese, gooey ripe Brie or an oozy baked Camembert. Make sure that you chop the figs and walnuts quite finely; if they are too chunky, it makes rolling the sticks more difficult. 250gstrongwhite bread flour, plus extra for dusting 5g instant dried yeast Y, tsp fine salt 1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for oiling About 175ml cold water 75g dried figs, cut into small pieces 50g walnuts, finely chopped Tip the flour into a large bowl. Add the yeast to one side and the salt to the other. Add the olive oil and three-quarters of the water and mix together using the fingers of one hand. Add as much of the remaining water as you need to incorporate all the flour and form akneadable dough (it doesn't need to be as soft as a typical bread dough). Tip the dough onto a lightly oiled surface and knead for 5-10 minutes, until smooth and elastic. Place the dough in an oiled bowl, cover with cling film and leave to stand for 1 hour. (The dough should rise but it doesn't need to double in size.) Heat your oven to 220°C/Gas 7 and line two baking trays with baking parchment. Tip the dough onto a lightly floured surface and fold it in on itself repeatedly until all the air is knocked out. Shape into a rectangle then scatter over the chopped figs and walnuts. Fold the dough over itself a few times to incorporate the fruit and nuts. The figs can make the dough sticky so flour your hands and work surface if necessary. Divide the dough into 16 equal pieces and roll each one into a thin stick, about 25-30cm in length. Lay the dough sticks on the prepared trays and bake for 12-15 minutes, until crisp and golden brown. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. BAKES OF THE WORLD 166 J I ' --\" CYPRIOT VILLAGE BREAD MAKES 1 LOAF This loaf, called 'kalouri', is the typical round bread of Cyprus. Mastika is the aromatic dried resin of the mastic tree and has a slightly aniseed flavour, and mahleb is made from the kernels of a type of cherry and has a sweet-sour almondyflavour. The recipe works without these ingredients but, for an authentic bread, you can source them online, or from a good continental deli or Middle Eastern shop. ~ tsp mastika resin (mastic) ~ tsp mechlebe seeds (mahleb) A pinch of sugar 450g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting 7g instant dried yeast 5gfinesalt 3 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for oiling About 300rnl cold water 2 tbsp sesame seeds 1 tbsp black sesame seeds (ornigellaseeds) - .. . .. Using a pestle and mortar, grind the mastika and mechlebe seeds with a pinch of sugar to a powder. Put the flour into a large bowl. Add the yeast to one side and the salt to the other. Add the ground spices and olive oil. Pour three-quarters of the water into the bowl and turn the mixture around with the fingers of one hand, mixing the water into the flour. Continue to add the remaining water, a little at a time, until all the flour is incorporated and you have a rough dough. The dough needs to be soft but not soggy. (You may not need all the water or you may need a little more; it depends on the flour.) Coat the work surface with a little olive oil then carefully tip the dough onto it and knead for 5-10 minutes until soft and smooth. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a clean tea towel and leave to rise until doubled in size. This will take at least an hour and can take 3 hours or longer, depending on the room temperature. Meanwhile, put all the sesame seeds into a bowl, pour on enough hot water to cover and leave to soak and swell while the dough is rising. Line a large baking tray with baking parchment. Tip the risen dough onto a lightly floured surface and fold it inwards repeatedly until all the air is knocked out. Now shape the dough into a ball. To do this, first flatten the dough into a rough rectangle then roll it up into a thick oblong. Turn the dough so that the longer edge is running away from you and flatten it slightly. Now fold the two ends in towards the centre and press them down, so you end up with a chunky, squarish shape. BAKES OF THE WORLD 168 , I ' Turn the dough over, so the join is underneath. With your palms turned upwards, put your hands on each side, slightly under the dough. Turn the ball around, tucking the dough neatly under itself as it turns. You are gently forcing the sides of the dough down and underneath, to create a smooth, taut top and a rough underside. Try to avoid using too much extra flour during shaping if you can. Coat the top and sides of the loaf with the damp sesame seeds, gently pressing them on with your hands. Put the loaf on the prepared tray, then place in a large, clean plastic bag and leave to prove for an hour, or until doubled in size. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 220°C/ Gas 7. Remove the proved loaf from the bag. Just before baking, score the bread about lcm deep around its circumference about halfway down. Also make a couple of2cm deep slashes on top of the loaf. Bake for 30-35 minutes until golden brown and cooked through. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. Photograph overleaf I / I ' • '\\ \" ·' • ,•, ~ , . • • i ... , \\ ... ' ...

Tip onto a lightly floured surface and fold inwards repeatedly until all the air is knocked out. Push down on the dough with your knuckles to shape it into a rectangle, about 25 x 20cm. Crumble the cheese over the surface and scatter over the chives. Fold the dough in on itself a few times, until the cheese and chives are evenly distributed. Flatten the dough into a rectangle again, with a long side facing you. Fold the long side furthest from you into the middle of the rectangle. Then fold the long side closest to you into the middle, on top of the other fold. Turn the loaf over, so you have a smooth top with a seam running along the base. Tuck the ends of the loaf under to create a rough oval shape. Roll the dough firmly but gently so the ends are tapered and you have a fat torpedo shape. Place on the prepared tray with the join underneath. Put the tray inside a large, clean plastic bag and leave the loaf to prove until it has risen and doubled in size. This will take at least an hour and may take up to 3 hours, depending on the room temperature. Heat your oven to 220°C/ Gas 7. Take the tray from the bag. Using a sharp knife, make 3 diagonal slashes, about 2cm deep, in the top of the loaf. Bake for 30-35 minutes, until golden brown. Cool on a wire rack. BAKES OF THE WORLD 172 PITT AS MAKES 4 LARGE OR 6 MEDIUM PITTAS The key to a good pitta is to get your oven as hot as possible but at the same time not to over-bake the breads- you don't want them crispy. They're ready when a fleck of colour appears on the top. If your oven is glass-fronted, keep an eye on them without opening the door. 300g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting 7ginstantdriedyeast 5gfinesalt 1 tbsp dried oregano About 200m! cold water 1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for oiling Tip the flour into a large bowl. Put the yeast to one side and the salt to the other. Add the oregano, then pour in three-quarters of the water and add the olive oil. Mix the ingredients together using the fingers of one hand, making sure you gather in all the flour from the side of the bowl. Add the remaining water a little at a time until all the flour is incorporated and you have a smooth, soft dough. (You may not need all the water or you may need a little more; it depends on the flour.) Coat the work surface with a little olive oil then tip the dough onto it. Knead for 5-10 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. Put the dough into a lightly oiled bowl. Cover and leave to rise until the dough has doubled in size. This will take at least an hour and can take 2-3 hours or longer, depending on the room temperature. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 250°C/ Gas 10 (or as high as it will go) and put a baking stone or a large heavy-duty baking tray on the top shelf to heat up. Tip the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knock back by folding the dough in on itself repeatedly until all the air is knocked out. Divide the dough into 4 or 6 equal pieces and shape each one into a ball. Roll out each ball to an oval, 1cm thick. Carefully take the hot trays from the oven and dust with flour. Lay the pittas on the trays and bake for 5- 10 minutes until the breads begin to puff up and just start to colour. Wrap in a clean cloth to help keep them soft. Best eaten warm. BAKES OF THE WORLD 175 NO-KNEAD BREAD MAKES 1 LOAF Travelling the world and meeting like-minded enthusiastic bakers is one of the most enjoyable parts of my work. This recipe originates from celebrated New York City baker Jim Lahey, who came up with the idea of an amazing bread that requires no kneading. He baked it in a Dutch oven, giving the bread its characteristic thick crust. I bake mine in a tin instead. It has a great flavour, good structure with large air pockets and an artisan look. It's a loaf to be proud of- and one that anyone can make. You just need to allow plenty of time for the long, slow rise. 400gstrongwhite bread flour, plus extra for dusting Sgfine salt 2g instant dried yeast (Yz tsp) About 300rnl cold water Fine semolina, wheat bran or extra flour, for dusting the surface Tip the flour into a large bowl. Put the yeast to one side and the salt to the other. Add the water and use a wooden spoon or your hand to mix everything together until you have a wet, sticky dough; this will only take around 30 seconds. The dough should be very sticky to the touch; if it isn't, add another 1-2 tbsp water. Cover the bowl with cling film and leave at room temperature (but out of direct sunlight), until the dough has more than doubled in size and the surface is dotted with bubbles. This will take at least 8 hours. Once the dough is risen, generously dust your work surface with flour. Use aplastic dough scraper or a spatula to scrape the dough out of the bowl in one piece onto the floured surface. As you pull the dough away from the edge of the bowl, it will cling in long, thin strands and will be quite loose and sticky. Don't be tempted to add more flour. Dust your hands with flour and lift the edges of the dough in towards the centre. Tuck the edges in to form a round shape. Place the dough, smooth side uppermost, in a 20cm springform tin and dust the surface with flour, semolina or wheat bran. Cover and leave to rise for 8 hours. Heat your oven to 220°C/ Gas 7. Bake the loaf for about 20 minutes, then lower the oven setting to 200°C/Gas 6 and bake for a further 40 minutes, until the crust is a deep chestnut colour. Remove the loaf from the tin and place on a wire rack to cool. Don't be tempted to cut or tear the bread until it has cooled completely; this will take at least an hour. BAKES OF THE WORLD 177 PESHWARI NAAN BREAD MAKES 6 This is a recipe for a classic Peshwari naan, suitable for the home cook. Once you've mastered the recipe, you can play around with flavours for your naan, adding black cumin, caraway or poppy seeds, or brushing them at the end with different flavoured oils, such as a garlic-infused oil or walnut oil. --------------------~--~~--------------~-------~~------------------ 450g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting Y. tsp baking powder 5g instant dried yeast 1 tsp fine salt 2 tsp caster sugar About 150ml warm whole milk About 150ml natural yoghurt 2 tbsp sunflower or vegetable oil, plus extra for oiling 25g desiccated coconut 25gsultanas 25g flaked almonds 25gunsalted butter Mix the flour and baking powder together in a bowl and add the yeast to one side and the salt and sugar to the other. Heat the milk in a pan over a low heat until warm, then remove from the heat and mix with the yoghurt. Pour three-quarters of this liquid into the flour and mix together using the fingers of one hand. Add as much of the remaining liquid as you need to gather in all the flour and form a rough dough that comes away from the side of the bowl. Coat the work surface with a little oil then tip the dough out onto it. Knead for 5-10 minutes until the dough is smooth and elastic. Place in a lightly oiled bowl, cover and leave to rise for 1 hour. Tip the dough onto a lightly floured surface and knock back by folding it in on itself repeatedly until all the air is knocked out. Roll out into a rough rectangle and scatter the coconut, sultanas and flaked almonds over the surface. Fold the dough over repeatedly to incorporate the filling then roll into a ball. Divide the dough into 6 pieces and shape each one into a ball. Flatten each ball then roll into a teardrop shape, about 3-5mm thick. Heat a large frying pan over a medium-high heat and add 1 tsp oil and 1 tsp butter. Once the butter has melted, lay one piece of dough in the pan. Cook for 3-4 minutes, or until the underside is turning golden and speckled with brown patches. Turn over and cook the other side for 2 minutes, or until it is speckled with brown and cooked through. Remove the naan from the pan and wrap it in a clean tea towel (this helps to keep it soft); keep warm. Cook the remaining naan in the same way, adding a little more oil and butter to the pan as required. Enjoy with your favourite curry. BAKES OF THE WORLD 178 DOS AS MAKES 6 You need to plan ahead when making these South Indian pancakes as the rice and lentils need soaking. They are then ground and the batter is left to ferment. It's not difficult but practice and patience are required. You need the right consistency for the batter, to cook it at the right temperature and to get the dosas as thin as possible. Buy skinned, split lentils for this recipe. My optional filling is a tasty dry potato curry to spread on the dosas. ------------------------~------~---.----------·------·~---------------- For the dosas 250g basmati rice 75g urid dal (skinned and split black lentils) Y. tsp fenugreek seeds 500mlwater Y. tsp fine salt Sunflower oil, for cooking For the filling Potato mas ala (see opposite) and/or a small jar of your favourite chutney Wash the rice and lentils in a sieve then place in a large bowl with the fenugreek seeds. Cover with the water and leave to soak for at least 6 hours, or overnight. Drain the rice and lentils, saving 250ml of the liquid. Put the soaked rice and lentils into a blender and pour in 175ml of the liquid. Blitz thoroughly, scraping down the sides occasionally. Add the remaining liquid and blend to a completely smooth batter. Pour the batter into a bowl, cover with a clean tea towel and leave to stand and ferment overnight. The batter should be slightly risen and have small bubbles on the surface. The consistency should be slightly thicker than pancake batter, so add a little more water if it is too thick. Stir in the salt. Heat a 20cm frying pan over a medium heat and wipe the surface with an oiled wad of kitchen paper. Using a ladle or large spoon, pour enough batter into the centre of the pan to coat the base as thinly as possible, using the bottom of the ladle or spoon to spread it out. Cook for about 2 minutes until the underside is golden, then use a palette knife to turn the do sa. Cook for a minute on the other side, then remove to a warmed plate. Repeat until all the batter is used, stacking the dosas interleaved with greaseproofpaper; keep them warm in a low oven. Wipe the pan with more oil as necessary to stop the batter sticking. Spread the cooked dosas with a thin layer of potato masala and/or chutney, roll up and eat straight away. BAKES OF THE WORLD 180 POTATO MASALA Peel2large potatoes (about 500g), cut into large chunks and cook in boiling salted water until tender. Drain, return to the pan and shake to roughen the surface. Heat a large saute pan and add 3 tbsp sunflower oil. When hot, add 2 tsp urid dal, Y2 tsp mustard seeds and Y2 tsp cumin seeds. Stir to coat in the oil. Cook for 1 minute, until the lentils darken in colour and the seeds begin to pop. Add 15 small curry leaves and 1 chopped onion, lower the heat and cook for 7- 8 minutes or until the onion begins to soften. Add lOOml water, cover and cook for 10 minutes or until the onion is very soft and the liquid has reduced down. Add 2 sliced green chillies ( deseeded for less heat, if preferred), a finely grated 2cm piece of ginger, Y2 tsp ground turmeric and Y2 tsp fine salt. Stir and cook for a few minutes until the liquid has evaporated. Add the potato chunks and stir to coat them in the spices - don't worry if they break down; this is a dry curry that is intended to be spreadable. Stir through 2 tbsp chopped coriander or flat-leafparsley, then taste and adjust the seasoning before serving. Photograph overleaf SPICY SAUSAGE SCACCIA MAKES 1 LOAF Scaccia is a traditional Sicilian stuffed and layered bread that I came across when filming there once. Sicily is very different to other parts ofl taly and I could see similarities between Sicilians and Cypriots as Mediterranean islanders with strong family bonds that relate a lot to foods, including bakes such as this one. Serve it with salad for lunch or supper. 150gstrongwhite bread flour, plus extra for dusting 100g fine semolina 5g instant dried yeast Y, tsp fine salt 1 tbsp olive oil, plus extra for oiling About 175ml cold water For the filling 2 tbsp olive oil llarge onion, diced 1 garlic clove, finely chopped ~ tsp dried chilli flakes Y, tsp fennel seeds 400g good-quality sausages Y, tsp fine salt A large bunch of flat-leaf parsley, roughly chopped 200g ricotta, drained if necessary lOg Parmesan, finely grated To finish Olive oil, for brushing 1 tsp fennel seeds Y, tsp dried chilli flakes Mix the flour and semolina together in a large bowl. Add the yeast to one side and the salt to the other. Make a well in the middle and pour in the olive oil and three-quarters of the water. Turn the mixture around with your fingers, adding more of the water, until all the flour is incorporated and you have a rough dough. The dough needs to be soft but not soggy. (You may not need all the water or you may need a little more; it depends on the flour.) Coat your work surface with a little olive oil, then tip the dough onto it and knead for 5-10 minutes until the dough is smooth and silky. Place the dough in a clean bowl, cover and leave to rise until doubled in size. This will take at least an hour and can take 2-3 hours or even longer, depending on the room temperature. The longer it takes, the more flavour the dough will develop; ideally, leave it somewhere cool, but not the fridge. To make the filling, heat the olive oil in a pan, add the onion and fry gently until soft but not coloured. Add the garlic, chilli flakes and fennel seeds and cook, stirring occasionally, for 2-3 minutes. Remove from the pan with a slotted spoon and set aside. Remove the sausages from their skins and add them to the pan with the salt. Cook over a medium-high heat, using a wooden spoon to break the sausages down into small pieces. Cook until the pieces of sausage are brown and a little crisp on the outside. Remove from the heat, return the onion mixture to the pan and stir to distribute evenly. Once cooled, stir through the chopped parsley. Continued overleaf BAKES OF THE WORLD 184 Heat your oven to 200°C/ Gas 6 and line a baking tray with baking parchment. When the dough is ready, tip it onto a floured surface. Roll it out into a rough rectangle, about 40 x 30cm. Turn the dough goo if necessary, so you have a long side facing you. Take a third of the meat and place it in aline along the bottom, leaving a 3cm clear margin at the edge. Dot a third of the ricotta over the meat then sprinkle with a third of the Parmesan. Roll the dough up from the bottom, enclosing the filling in the dough (rather like a Swiss roll). As soon as the filling is encased, stop rolling and add another line of meat, ricotta and Parmesan. Roll the dough up again to enclose the filling. Continue with a third layer of filling, which will lie towards the top edge of the dough. Now roll up again so you have a large cylinder of filled dough. Trim the ends. Pull the cylinder of dough to straighten and make sure it is even all the way along. Rotate the cylinder of dough goo on the work surface so that it extends away from you then, starting at the top, coil the dough into an upwards spiral. Place the loaf on the baking tray, brush with olive oil and scatter over the fennel seeds and chilli flakes. Bake for 25-30 minutes until crisp and golden. Transfer the loaf to a wire rack to cool slightly and serve hot or warm. BAKES OF THE WORLD 186 SPANAKOPITA SERVES 6 Spanakopita is a celebrated dish in Cyprus, and naturally everyone thinks that they make the best one. The flavour, the flakiness, the bake, all make this special. It's a great dish that can be made in advance for gatherings of family and friends- it even appeals to those kids who think they don't like spinach. 1 tbsp olive oil Heat the olive oil in a large frying pan over a low heat.

Lay 7 sheets offilo on a clean work surface and cut each one in half (the pieces will be slightly bigger than your tin). Brush one piece offilo with melted butter and lay, buttered-side up, in the prepared tin to line the base and sides. Repeat with another 6 pieces offilo, brushing each one with butter before placing in the tin. Pack the filling into the filo-lined tin. Layer the remaining pieces offilo on top, brushingeachlayerwithmelted butter and tucking the sides in around the edges of the pie. Brush the top of the pie with melted butter then, using a sharp knife, mark into 6 portions, cutting through the top few layers offilo. Bake for 35- 40 minutes, until the pastry is a rich golden brown colour and crisp. Serve hot, warm or at room temperature. BAKES OF THE WORLD 189 COURGETTE PIZZA WITH RICOTTA & THYME MAKES 2 LARGE PIZZAS This is a light, summery pizza with fresh flavours. The dough uses a small amount of yeast and has a lengthy prove to develop an amazing flavour. I once worked with a guy called Enzo, one of the best pizza makers inN aples, who was particular about details. He even claimed you've got to mix the dough in a clockwise direction ... that's how myths and legends start! --------------------~··----~~----·----~----·.--·--~~--·-·~~~.~---------------- For the dough 300g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting 2g instant dried yeast (Y, tsp) ltsp fine salt About 220ml cold water Oil, for oiling For the topping lcourgette 2 tbsp olive oil 30g Parmesan, finely grated 30g Gruyere, finely grated 125g ball ofbuffalo mozzarella, torn or cut into chunks 125g ricotta Finely grated zest of Y. lemon A small handful of thyme sprigs Sea salt and black pepper For the dough, put the flour into a bowl and add the yeast to one side and the salt to the other. Add three-quarters of the water and mix with the fingers of one hand. Gradually add more water to form a very soft dough that comes away from the side of the bowl. (You may not need it all or you may need more. I like pizza dough to be as wet as possible.) Turn the dough onto an oiled surface and knead for 5-10 minutes, until smooth and elastic. To check it's kneaded sufficiently, cut off a small piece and stretch part of it as thinly as you can. If it doesn't tear and the light shines through, it's ready. If not, keep going. Shape into a ball, place in a clean bowl, cover and leave to rest for 10-12 hours. Divide the dough in half and form each piece into a ball. Stretch or roll each ball into a thin circle, about 26cm in diameter, and place on a floured baking tray. Heat your oven to 220°C/Gas 7 and put a pizza stone or flat baking tray on the top shelf to heat up for 30 minutes. For the topping, using a swivel vegetable peeler, cut the courgette into ribbons. Toss in a bowl with 1 tbsp olive oil and some salt and pepper. Place one pizza dough base on the hot stone or tray and bake for 3-4 minutes. Take it out and switch the oven to grill setting. Scatter half the grated cheeses and mozzarella over the pizza base. Trickle over Y2 tbsp olive oil then lay half the courgette ribbons on top. Dot with teaspoonfuls ofricotta, using half of it. Slide the pizza into the oven, placing it 10cm or so from the grill. Cook for 4-5 minutes, until the topping is bubbling; watch closely to ensure the crust doesn't burn. Repeat the process to cook the other pizza. Just before serving, sprinkle with the grated lemon zest and thyme sprigs. BAKES OF THE WORLD 190 JULE V0RTBR0D MAKES 1 LOAF This yeasted fruit bread comes from Scandinavia, where it's traditionally made with the local non-alcoholic fruit beer. Fruit breads and cakes are found in many countries and this one is akin to the tea bread that I remember eating as a child. 500gstrongwhite bread flour, plus extra for dusting 50g cold unsalted butter, cut into small dice 60g caster sugar lOg instant dried yeast 1 tsp ground star anise (or 2 whole star anise, ground) Y. tsp ground cloves Y. tsp ground cinnamon Y, tsp ground cardamom (or seeds from 15 pods, ground) Y. tsp ground pepper 1 tsp fine salt 150ml fruit beer 150ml whole milk, plus extra to glaze 400graisins Icing sugar, sifted, for dusting Put the flour into a large bowl, add the butter and rub in using your fingertips until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Stir in the sugar and yeast, then the ground spices and salt, making sure they are evenly distributed. Add the beer and begin to mix, then gradually incorporate the milk and mix to form a rough dough. Tip the dough out onto a lightly floured surface and knead it for 5-10 minutes until smooth and elastic. Flatten into a rough rectangle, scatter a quarter of the raisins over the surface, then fold the dough over itself a couple of times to disperse the fruit. Repeat this three times until all the raisins are incorporated and evenly distributed through the dough. Place the dough in a bowl, cover and leave to rise until doubled in size. This will take at least 3 hours and may take longer; the quantity of fruit makes this loaf take longer to rise. Line a baking tray with baking parchment. Tip the risen dough out onto a lightly floured work surface and knock out the air by folding it in on itself repeatedly. Flatten the dough into a rectangle and fold the long sides into the middle. Roll up so the top is smooth and you have a join running along the middle of the underside. The loaf should be an oval shape. Place on the lined baking tray and put the tray inside a large, clean plastic bag. Leave to prove for about 2 hours - it is ready when the dough springs back when lightly pressed. Heat your oven to 180°C/ Gas 4. Remove the tray from the bag and brush the loaf with milk to glaze. Bake for 40-50 minutes, until risen and the crust is dark brown. Transfer to a wire rack to cool. Dust with sifted icing sugar before serving sliced, with butter. BAKES OF THE WORLD 193 LOUKOUMADES SERVES 6 These light and fluffy Greek doughnuts are soaked in an orange-infused honey syrup and taste fantastic.

Put the yeast to one side and the salt to the other. Add the honey to the tepid water in a jug and stir to dissolve. Gradually add the honey liquid to the flour and stir, then beat with a wooden spoon until you have a thick batter with no lumps. Cover and leave to stand for an hour until the batter has risen to double in volume and is very lively with lots ofbubbles on the surface. Meanwhile, to make the orange syrup, put all the ingredients into a saucepan and slowly bring to the boil, then simmer for 10-15 minutes until the syrup reduces and thickens slightly but is still pourable (it will thicken further as it cools). Leave to cool. Pour enough oil into a deep, heavy saucepan to fill it by no more than a third (or use a deep-fryer and more oil). Heat the oil to 180°C, or until a cube ofbread dropped into the hot oil turns brown in about 1 minute. You will need to cook the doughnuts in batches, ideally 5 or 6 at a time, to avoid overcrowding the pan. Carefully drop large teaspoonfuls of the batter into the hot oil. They will puff up and begin to turn golden. Cook for about 2-3 minutes on each side, turning them with tongs to ensure they cook evenly. Try to maintain the oil at a constant temperature. Remove the doughnuts from the oil using a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. Once all the doughnuts are cooked, pour half the orange syrup into a large bowl, add the hot doughnuts and walnuts and toss to coat in the syrup, adding more syrup if needed. Sprinkle with the ground cinnamon and serve hot, with Greek yoghurt and the rest of the orange syrup in a small jug on the side.

Lay a sheet offilo on your work surface and brush with butter. Lay another sheet of pastry on top and brush with butter. Spread out one-fifth of the walnut filling (about 3Y2 tbsp) along the long edge nearest you. Roll up tightly, as if you were rolling a Swiss roll. Trim the ends that contain little filling. Form the roll into a spiral and place it in the middle of the prepared tin. Repeat the process to make another 4 rolls, coiling each one and arranging them in the tin around the central spiral to form a ring. You don't want the spirals to be too tight- the edges of each roll need to get the chance to cook. Brush the top and outside edges of the spirals with melted butter, then bake for 30-35 minutes, or until the baklava is golden brown. Meanwhile, make the syrup: place all the ingredients in a pan and bring to the boil. Lower the heat and simmer for about 10 minutes, or until reduced and thickened to a pourable syrup. Slice the baklava into Scm pieces, leaving them in the tin, then pour on the syrup while the pastry is still hot. Let the baklava sit and soak up the syrup for an hour before serving. Store any that won't be eaten straight away in a non-metallic container. BAKES OF THE WORLD 196 r BLUEBERRY CHEESECAKE MAKES 12 SLICES The perfect cheesecake is slightly under-set and the Americans make the best. I fell for this particular one when filming in Miami at a restaurant specialising in seafood. After eating fish all day, it tasted especially good. For the base 150gunsalted butter, softened 75g caster sugar 150g plain flour A pinch of fine salt 50g semolina (or ground rice) 100gblueberryjam For the filling 400g full-fat cream cheese 1 tbsp custard powder 50g caster sugar 2 medium eggs 1 tsp vanilla extract 125ml double cream 125gblueberries Heat your oven to 150°C/Gas 2. Grease a 27 x 18cm baking tin, about 4cm deep, and line with baking parchment. For the base, beat the butter and sugar together in a large bowl until light and fluffy. Add the flour, salt and semolina (or ground rice) and bring everything together to form a dough; try not to overwork it. Press the mixture onto the base of the baking tin. Lay a sheet ofbaking parchment on top, press evenly to level the base, then remove. Prick the base all over with a fork. Bake for 35-40 minutes until cooked but still pale. Leave to cool in the tin. Turn the oven up to 175°C/Gas 3 Y2. To make the filling, in a large bowl, slowly beat 100g cream cheese with the custard powder and 1 tbsp of the sugar, using a hand-held electric whisk, until smooth. Add another 100g cream cheese with 1 tbsp sugar and whisk again on a low speed, scraping down the sides of the bowl every so often as you go. Repeat twice more, until all the cream cheese and sugar are incorporated. Don't be tempted to rush this stage; this careful process creates the velvety smooth texture. Whisk in the eggs, one at a time, on a medium speed then incorporate the vanilla and cream. Finally, carefully fold in the blueberries. Spread the jam over the cooled base. Spoon on the filling and spread out in an even layer. Stand the tin in a large roasting tray and pour in enough cold water to come halfway up the sides of the tin. Bake for 35-40 minutes, or until the edges of the cheesecake are lightly golden and the centre has a slight wobble. Lift out of the roasting tin. Carefully lift the cheesecake in its parchment from the tin and transfer to a wire rack to cool. Once cold, peel away the parchment and place the cheesecake on a plate. Refrigerate for at least 4 hours to firm up. Cut the cheesecake into slices, using a knife dipped into just-boiled water. Eat just as it is, or serve with extra berries. BAKES OF THE WORLD 199 CHERRY TART SERVES 8 Here's a fabulous tart that I came across on a trip to Paris. There's the shortbread -like pastry, the soft creamy filling, then the fruit: it all comes together and melts in your mouth. ----------------------·----------~-~·~--···--·--~·--~--~~~--~--------------- For the pastry 200gplain flour 2 tbsp icing sugar 100g cold unsalted butter, cut into small dice llarge egg yolk 2-3 tbsp cold water For the custard filling 400rnl whole milk 4large egg yolks lOOg caster sugar 3 tbsp cornflour 1 tsp vanilla extract 1 tbsp kirsch 125rnl whipping cream For the topping 350g cherries, pitted and halved 4 tbsp cherry jam 1 tbsp kirsch To make the pastry, mix the flour and icing sugar together in a large bowl and rub in the butter using your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Mix the egg yolk with 2 tbsp water, then stir into the rubbed-in mixture, using a round-bladed knife. Add the extra water if needed to bring the dough together. Gently knead into a smooth ball, wrap in cling film and chill for at least 30 minutes. To make the custard, slowly heatthe milk in a pan until it just comes to the boil. Meanwhile, in a large bowl, whisk together the egg yolks, sugar and cornflour. As the milk comes to the boil, pour it onto the egg mixture, whisking as you do so. Pour back into the pan and heat gently, stirring constantly, for about 5 minutes until the custard thickens. Take off the heat and stir in the vanilla and kirsch. Pour into a clean bowl and cover the surface closely with cling film to prevent a skin forming. Leave to cool (then refrigerate if making well in advance). Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface to about a 30cm circle and use to line a 23cm loose-based fluted tart tin, 3.5cm deep, leaving a little excess pastry overhanging the edge. Prick the base all over with a fork, then chill in the fridge for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Line the pastry case with baking parchment and fill with baking beans. Bake 'blind' for 12-15 minutes until the pastry is dry to the touch, then remove the paper and beans and return to the oven for 5 minutes or so, until the base is dry and the pastry is lightly coloured. Let cool, then use a small, sharp knife to trim the excess pastry from the edge. To assemble the tart, whip the cream to soft, firm peaks and fold into the cold custard. Spoon into the cooled pastry case then spread out to level the surface. Starting from the outer edge, arrange the cherry halves in concentric circles on top of the tart to cover it completely. Warm the cherry jam with the kirsch, press through a sieve, then brush this glaze over the cherries. Refrigerate until ready to serve. BAKES OF THE WORLD 200 MARZIPAN &APPLE TART SERVES 4-6 This is my spin on a Normandy apple tart. Making your own marzipan is crucial; shop-bought doesn't have such a high proportion of almonds and will melt. The flavour of the apples balances the flavour of the nuts beautifully. For the marzipan llOg ground almonds 50g icing sugar, sifted, plus extra for dusting 50g caster sugar A few drops of almond extract 'l:i: tsp lemon juice 2 medium egg yolks For thefrangipane 40gunsalted butter, softened 40g caster sugar lmediumegg 20g plain flour 30g ground almonds For the apple layer llarge or 2 medium eating apple(s) 2 tbsp apricot jam ltbspwater To make the marzipan, mix the ground almonds and both sugars together in a large bowl. Add the almond extract, lemon juice and egg yolks and mix to combine. At first, the mixture will feel dry and crumbly but keep squeezing and kneading and it will come together. When it starts to form a ball, lightly dust your work surface with icing sugar and knead the marzipan on it to form a smooth paste. Wrap in cling film and chill in the fridge for at least 30 minutes. To make the frangipane, beat the butter and sugar together until the mixture is light and fluffy, then add the egg and combine well. Add the flour and ground almonds and mix to a smooth, thick paste. Heat your oven to 190°C/ Gas 5 and line a baking tray with a sheet of baking parchment. Dust the work surface with icing sugar again and roll out the marzipan to an 18cm circle, about Smm thick (use a plate as a template). Lift it onto the prepared baking tray. Spread the frangipane over the marzipan in a thick layer, leaving a Smm clear margin around the edge. Quarter and core the apple(s) then cut into 3mm slices. Arrange the apple slices over the frangipane in concentric circles. Bake for 12- 15 minutes, until the frangipane is risen and golden brown. Heat the apricot jam with the water and press through a sieve. Brush the apricot glaze over the top of the warm tart. Serve with cream, or just as it is. BAKES OF THE WORLD 203 FIG, PECAN & CHEESE TART SERVES 6 I first saw this impressive tart in France and loved the way it plays around with flavours, mixing the sweet and the savoury.

For the pastry, blitz the nuts in a food processor until finely chopped. Using an electric whisk, beat the butter and sugar together in a bowl until pale and fluffy. Add the egg yolk and mix until just combined. Add the flour, baking powder, salt and ground pecans and fold in, using a large metal spoon, until evenly incorporated. The pastry will be very soft at this stage, so scrape it together to form a ball, then place between two sheets of grease proof paper. Roll out the pastry thinly between the paper to a 20cm circle, 1-2cm thick. Remove the top sheet of paper and invert the pastry onto the base of the greased tin. Remove the other sheet of paper. Push the dough into the fluted edge of the tin and press the base to level the surface. Prick all over with a fork. Cover loosely with baking parchment and place in the fridge to rest for 6-8 hours, or overnight. Heat your oven to 170°C/ Gas 3 'lz . Remove the parchment covering the pastry base then bake in the oven for 20-25 minutes, until golden brown. Leave it to firm up and cool down completely. For the filling, using a hand -held electric whisk, beat the mascarpone, cream cheese, blue cheese and honey together until smooth. Put into a piping bag fitted with a lcm nozzle, or use a paper piping bag and snip lcm off the tip. (Alternatively, the filling can be spread rather than piped onto the base.) To assemble the tart, carefully remove the pastry case from the tin and place on a serving plate. Pipe peaks of the whipped cheese filling in concentric circles over the base (or spread it evenly using a metal spoon). Arrange the fig wedges on top of the filling and finish with the chopped pecans. Drizzle over the honey just before serving. BAKES OF THE WORLD 204 A RETURN TO BRITISH BAKING TELEVISION IS A DIFFERENT WAY ofteaching.Peopleliketo be entertained as they learn- you know that from back at school and the teachers who made you want to listen. I want viewers to get little nuggets that they can take back to the kitchen and use. When I came back to live in Britain in 1999, I started to run my own bakeries and at the same time began to appear on Tv. I'm not quite sure why but being in front of a camera came naturally. The advice is always to be yourself. I'm not an actor so it was straightforward to do just that. It was 2010 when I got a call from Love Productions telling me about a new programme they were making. Would I be interested in auditioning? Someone from the production team came to my house, tipped out a bag ofbakes and said: judge them. Then I met my fellow presenters and it all fell into place. You cannot fake chemistry; it happens from day one. The programme really started to take shape in the first series. In the original Bake Offline up, Mary was everyone's grandma, including mine. She was from the tradition ofhome baking. I was used to dealing in 20kg of flour for making batches ofbread, while Mary thinks in grams. She was the comforting arm around the shoulder while I was more the teacher who said, 'I think you should do this, see me afterwards.' My job was to be a straight, honest and fair judge. You have to give constructive criticism so the contestants learn. Bake Off is ajourney for them, just as baking has been for me in my own life. Mel and Sue were the gel between us all who kept us sane. They lightened the mood and everyone was happier for it. But Bake Off is not about the hosts and the judges, it's about the bakers- they are the stars of the show. It's important for them to manage their time properly in order to succeed- and the same thing is true in a professional bakery. A bakery has to be working at all levels, immediately, because if your ovens are SHOWSTOPPING PIES, PUDS & CAKES 208 .. l I \" on and not being used, you're wasting money. So you plan your time carefully. That's also true at home, when you want to be efficient as you bake, and make the most of your time. The bakers need two other qualities to do well: technique and artistic flair. Most have a bit of one aspect, and a lot of the other. Some might be talented and artistic, but have more style than substance. The skill is to marry the two together. When you get both, it's magical. The ones who do well in the competition tend to develop over time. And sometimes they're lucky, because another baker just happens to have done worse that day. The challenges we set for contestants show off and test their skills, and encourage people at home to bake. The Showstopper is the 'wow factor'. It's most often a highly decorated bake and this is where a baker's creativity shines through. What viewers get from this is ideas - how to create three-tiered cakes, how to make something look good. Some of the recipes in this chapter, such as the Swiss roll and the roulade, are more of a technical challenge that you can learn and then adapt to your own tastes. I've also given recipes for some of my favourite pies, a British tradition that we feature in the programme. Then there are the recipes that take technique to perfect, such as a mirror glaze on a cake. And there are some impressive pudding recipes, including souflles, that aren't that difficult to make once you've learnt a few tricks. People watching an elaborate cake being prepared may think, 'I don't think I could make that.' But there are also ways to make a bake special with the minimum amount of work and fuss. Part of this is flavour. But be careful - stick with flavours that you like and know work well together. There are lots of trendy and strange tastes out there. In reality you'll probably prefer coconut, banana, strawberry to Earl Grey or lavender. If you're dealing with flavours such as lavender, rosemary or rose then be sparing. Don't go crazy because the taste will kill everything. SHOWSTOPPING PIES, PUDS & CAKES 209 When I first started doing television, baking was seen as niche. But Bake Offhas had far more people watching it than any other cookery show. Sales ofbakeware, food mixers and different kinds of flours have soared and I can even see its impact in my day-to-day life. Everybody and anybody asks me about baking: 'My bread's too tight'; 'My cake's dropped in the middle'; 'How do I make a decent souffle?' The questions I get asked are many and varied. Builders shout out to me at the traffic lights- 'I burnt me cakes, mate, what am I doing wrong?' I get grandmas and kids coming up to me in supermarkets about their brownies. Why is this? It's because we're a nation ofbakers and we'd forgotten about that. We went through twenty years ofbuying stuff rather than making it. Now we've come back to making again. Some of the bakes in mainland Europe are complicated, but in this country we have some great basic bakes with good flavours. We've got a plethora of ingredients from all over the world to use. We've got some of the best flours. We've also got great bakers. No wonder people want to bake and learn more than ever before. SHOWSTOPPING PIES, PUDS & CAKES 211 BREAKFAST PIE SER V ES 6 This delicious pie takes its name from a filling that contains many of the ingredients of a classic English breakfast.

For the pastry 275gplainflour,plus extra for dusting A pinch of fine salt 135g cold unsalted butter, cut into small dice 1 medium egg, beaten 2-3 tbsp cold water 1 medium egg, beaten, to glaze For the filling To make the pastry, mix the flour with the salt in a large bowl. Add the butter and rub in lightly with your fingertips until the mixture looks like fine breadcrumbs. Make a well in the centre, add the egg with 2 tbsp water and mix with a round-bladed knife. Bring the dough together with your hand, adding the extra waterif necessary. Gently knead to form a smooth ball, wrap in cling film and rest in the fridge for 30 minutes. Preheat your grill to medium-high and grill the sausages until golden and cooked through. Leave to cool, then cut each one into 4 pieces. 3 traditional pork or Heat the oil in a wide frying pan over a medium heat. Add the onion Lincolnshire sausages and cook gently for about 8 minutes until soft. Add the bacon and 1 tbsp sunflower oil mushrooms, increase the heat and cook for 8-10 minutes until the 1large onion, finely chopped mushrooms are tender and any liquid they release has evaporated. 150g unsmoked streaky Leave to cool completely. bacon, diced SOg mushrooms, sliced 150gfull-fat cream cheese 5 medium eggs 100g mature Cheddar, grated 1 tbsp roughly chopped flat-leaf parsley Salt and white pepper Heat your oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Roll out two-thirds of the pastry on a lightly floured surface and use to line a 20cm loose-based tart tin, Scm deep, leaving a little excess overhanging the edge of the tin. Roll out the rest ofthe pastry and cut into 12-14 strips, each 1cm wide and 22cm long. On a board covered with a sheet ofba.king parchment, use the pastry strips to create a lattice, with 6- 7 strips going each way, weaving them under and over each other. Place in the fridge while you make the filling. In a large bowl, beat the cream cheese with 2 eggs until smooth. Add the grated cheese and chopped parsley and season with a little salt and a pinch of pepper. Stir in the cooled onion and bacon mixture, along with the sausage pieces. Spoon the filling into the pastry case and make 3 evenly spaced depressions in the surface. Crack the remaining eggs into them. Dampen the pastry rim with water and invert the lattice from the parchment onto the pie. Press the ends of the strips onto the pastry rim, then trim to neaten. Brush the pastry lattice with beaten egg to glaze. Bake the pie for 35-40 minutes, until golden brown. Leave to stand for 15 minutes before cutting. It can be eaten hot, warm or cold. HAGGIS PASTIES MAKES 5 Haggis is packed with flavour, making it an ideal pie filling. I've paired it with two typical accompaniments- neeps and tatties- and put them all in a pasty. For the pastry 450g plain flour, plus extra for dusting Y. tsp fine salt 115g cold lard, cut into small dice 75g cold unsalted butter, cut into small dice About 90rnl cold water 1 egg, beaten, to glaze For the filling 1onion 100g peeled swede 1large potato, peeled 400ghaggis 50gunsalted butter Salt and white pepper Line two baking trays with baking parchment. To make the pastry, mix the flour with the salt in a large bowl. Add the lard and butter and rub in lightly with your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs. Using a round-bladedknife, stir in just enough water to make a firm dough. Knead gently into a ball, wrap in cling film and place in the fridge to chill for at least 30 minutes. For the filling, thinly slice the onion and cut the swede and potato into small, thin pieces. Place each vegetable in its own bowl. Remove the uncooked haggis from its casing and crumble into another bowl. Heat your oven to 200°C/ Gas 6. Dust your work surface with flour and divide the pastry into 5 equal pieces. Roll out each piece to a round, about 3mm thick, and cut out a 24cm circle, using a plate as a guide. To fill and shape each pasty, scatter a thin layer of swede over half of the circle, leaving a lcm clear margin. Add a similar layer of potato, season lightly with salt and pepper, then top with some onion. Repeat the swede and potato layers, seasoning as you go and checking that the pastry will still go over the top to encase the filling. Top with a layer of crumbled haggis. Add a final layer of onion, season once more and dot with butter. Brush the pastry border with beaten egg, then fold the pastry over the filling, so the edges meet. Press these together firmly and crimp by pinching the pastry edge all round between the thumb and forefinger. Put the filled and sealed pasties on the prepared baking trays. Cut 2 slits in the centre of each pasty and brush the top with beaten egg. Bake the pasties for 20 minutes, then lower the oven setting to 160°C/Gas 3 and bake for a further 30 minutes until golden brown. These pasties are best eaten warm. SHOWSTOPPING PIES, PUDS & CAKES 214 BEEF &ALE PIE SERVES 4 This is comfort food at its best, with the beer giving the sauce both depth of flavour and richness. I'd recommend using bitter or stout. For the filling 2 tbsp plain flour 2 tsp English mustard powder Apinchoffine salt 700g chuck or other stewing steak, cut into 4cm chunks 2-4 tbsp sunflower oil 2large onions, sliced 2 celery sticks, cut into 1cmchunks 2 carrots, cut into Scm chunks 300ml beer (a good bitter or stout is best) 300ml rich beef stock A dash ofWorcestershire sauce 1 tsp dark brown sugar 1 bay leaf 2 sprigs of thyme Salt and black pepper For the suet pastry 375g self-raising flour, plus extra for dusting 175g shredded beef suet 200-250ml cold water To make the filling, put the flour and mustard into a bowl, season with a little salt and mix together. Add the pieces of meat and toss in the seasoned flour until evenly coated. Heat 2 tbsp oil in a large, flameproof casserole. When it is hot, quickly brown the meat in small batches on all sides, removing the pieces with a slotted spoon to a plate as soon as they are coloured, and adding more oil to the pan as necessary. Once all the meat is browned and set aside, add a little more oil to the pan if needed and cook the onions, celery and carrots over a medium -low heat, stirring occasionally, for about 5 minutes. Return the meat to the pan and stir, then pour in the beer and stock. Add the Worcestershire sauce, sugar, bay leaf, thyme and a little salt and pepper. Bring to the boil, then lower the heat to a simmer and cook gently, covered, for at least 2 hours, until the beef is tender. Tip the filling into a 1.2litre pie dish and leave to cool completely. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 200°C/Gas 6. To make the suet pastry, put the flour and suet into a large bowl, add some salt and pepper and stir to mix. Add 200rnl water and mix to a soft sticky dough with one hand, adding more water to bring the dough together if required. On a lightly floured surface, roll out the dough to a large oval, about Scm bigger than the top of your pie dish all round and 5-7mm thick. Cut a 2cm wide strip of pastry from around the outside. Dampen the rim of the pie dish with water, position the pastry strip on the rim and brush this with a little water. Lay the pastry oval over the top and press down the edges onto the pastry strip to seal. Crimp the edges to seal, then trim off the excess pastry. Bake the pie for 30-40 minutes until the pastry is golden brown. Let the pie stand for 10 minutes before serving. SHOWSTOPPING PIES, PUDS & CAKES 216 TOAD IN THE HOLE SERVES 4 This British classic is simple but special. In recent years, 'toad in the hole' has become part of fine dining, not just a family dish. Either way, I want good pork sausages or spicy Lincolnshire hangers. One of the keys to achieving the best batter is to use good eggs; get the freshest you can for the best results. Bsausages 60g beef dripping, in small pieces For the batter 125g plain flour 1 tsp fine salt 2largeeggs BOmlmilk About 40ml cold water Heat your oven to 220°C/Gas 7. First make the batter. Put the flour and salt into a bowl, make a well in the middle and add the eggs. Using a wooden spoon, beat the mixture to a thick paste, incorporating the flour from the sides of the well. Gradually add the milk and continue to mix until the batter is smooth and lump-free. Leave to restfor at least 30 minutes. Place the sausages and dripping in a 30 x 20cm roasting tray and cook for 15-20 minutes, until browned. Stir the cold water into the batter. It should now be the consistency of pouring cream; add a little more water if necessary. Remove the hot tray of sausages from the oven, turn the sausages over then pour in the batter mix- take care as the fat may spit. Return the roasting tray to the oven and cook for 20- 25 minutes, until the batter is risen and crisp. Don't be tempted to open the oven door before the batter is cooked as this will cause it to sink. Serve with mashed potatoes and gravy. SHOWSTOPPING PIES, PUDS & CAKES 219 RAISED PIE SERVES 4 A pork pie is one of my favourite foods- eaten with mustard and a pickled onion or tomato. Make your own and you can vary the seasoning and flavours to your taste. To mould your pie crust, you can use a wooden structure called a dolly, as I have here, or alternatively a baked bean tin or a pie tin. ------------------~~-·~--------·--.-~·--·-·~··~--~---~----~·~·----·~~~ .. --~----------------·· For the hot water crust pastry 250g plain flour, plus extra for dusting 50g strong white bread flour 40g cold unsalted butter, cut into small dice 50g cold lard, cut into small pieces lOOm! water \\.{ tsp fine salt 1 egg yolk, beaten, to glaze For the filling 150ggood-quality sausage meat 150g minced pork lOOg pork loin, cut into l cm dice 2 shallots, finely chopped Y. tsp ground mace \\.{ tsp fine salt A good pinch of white pepper 2 tbsp chopped fiat-leaf parsley For the jelly Y. chicken stock cube 150mljust-boiled water 3.2g leaf gelatine (2 sheets Costa brand) Preheat your oven to 200°C/ Gas 6 and line a baking tray with baking parchment. To make the hot water crust pastry, combine the flours in a large bowl and rub in the butter using your fingertips until the mixture resembles breadcrumbs. Put the lard, water and salt into a saucepan and place over a medium heat until the mixture just begins to boil, then immediately pour onto the flour and mix with a wooden spoon. Once cool enough to handle, gather the dough, tip onto a lightly floured surface and knead to form a smooth ball. Cut off a quarter of the dough for the lid and set aside (ideally in the still-warm pan used to heat the lard mix as this will help to keep it pliable). Working quickly (while the pastry is still warm), flatten the larger ball of dough with the palm of your hand. Take a 9.5 x llcm wooden pie dolly, dust with flour and sit it in the middle of the dough. Use your hands to raise the pastry up the sides of the dolly. Once you are almost halfway, turn the dolly upside down and work the pastry down the dolly until the pastry covers about three-quarters ofit. Trim the edge to neaten and leave the pastry to set slightly. To make the filling, mix all the ingredients together in a large bowl until well combined and shape into a cylinder, a bit smaller than the pie case on the dolly. Roll out the remaining pastry to a 12cm circle for the pie lid. Continued overleaf SHOWSTOPPING PIES, PUDS & CAKES 220 Use a small knife to ease the pastry case from the dolly then fill the cavity with the meat filling. (If the pastry falls down when it comes off the dolly just mould it up again over the meat.) Brush the edge of the pastry with beaten egg yolk and place the lid over the filling. Press the edges together to seal and trim off the excess pastry. Pinch the edges together to crimp decoratively. Carefully lift the pie onto the prepared baking tray and cut a small hole in the pastry lid to let the steam out. Brush the top and sides of the pie with the beaten egg, taking care to get the brush into the crimped edge. Bake for 50 minutes until the pastry is golden brown. Leave to cool slightly. In the meantime, to make the jelly, dissolve the stock cube in the boiling water in a bowl. Soak the gelatine leaves in a dish of cold water for a few minutes to soften. Lift out the gelatine, squeeze out any excess water, then add to the stock, stirring to dissolve. Insert a funnel into the hole in the top of the pie and gradually add the gelatine mixture to fill the cavity between the meat and the pastry- add it a little at a time and let the liquid seep down before pouring in more. Once the pie is cool enough, place it in the fridge to set the jelly for a few hours, or overnight.

This is a modern variation and a world away from the ones you buy at a service station. 4mediumeggs Y. tsp cumin seeds 275g minced pork BOg unsliced chorizo, skin removed and cut into small dice Y. tsp smoked paprika A pinch of dried chilli flakes ~ - Y. tsp fine salt For the coating 75g plain flour 3 medium eggs 150-200gwhite breadcrumbs Oil, for deep-frying Place the unshelled eggs in a pan, cover with water and bring to the boil. Boil for 7 minutes, then remove the eggs with a slotted spoon and immerse in cold water to cool quickly. Toast the cumin seeds in a dry frying pan for a couple of minutes until fragrant but not burnt, then grind coarsely, using a pestle and mortar. In a large bowl, mix the minced pork, chopped chorizo, toasted cumin, smoked paprika and chilli flakes together and add some salt. (To check the seasoning, break off a small piece of the mixture and fry in a little oil until cooked then taste it.) Remove the boiled eggs from the water, tap to break the shells, then peel. Take three bowls and tip the flour into one, lightly beat the eggs in another and place the breadcrumbs in the third. Divide the meat mixture into 4 equal portions. Lay a piece of cling film on your work surface, place a portion of the meat mixture on it and press down evenly to flatten. Take a boiled egg and dust with flour then sit on the flattened meat mixture. Bring the sides of the meat up around the egg, using the cling film to help wrap the egg; this also prevents the meat sticking to your hands. Dip the meat-wrapped egg in the beatE!n egg, then coat thoroughly in breadcrumbs. Dip in the egg and crumbs once more, giving it two coats for a crisper outside. Repeat with the other 3 boiled eggs. Refrigerate for at least 30 minutes. 1 Heat your oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Heat the oil into a deep-fryer or in a large, heavy saucepan, filling it is no more than one-third full. Heat theroil to 170°C, or until a cube ofbread dropped in turns brown in just over a minute. Deep-fry the eggs, two at a time, for 6-8 minutes until the outside is a deep golden brown colour, turning them over halfway through. Remove with a slotted spoon and drain on kitchen paper. To ensure the meat is cooked through, place the Scotch eggs on a baking tray in the oven for a further 8 minutes. Eat hot or cold . • .. • ·. .. • I ' , PUMPKIN PIE SERVES12 This traditional American pie has now become popular here as an autumnal dessert. I love the crisp base and the rich, spiced taste of the filling. For the pastry 200g plain flour, plus extra for dusting 2 tbsp icing sugar, sifted 1 tsp ground cinnamon 100g cold unsalted butter, cut into small dice 1 medium egg, beaten About 2 tsp very cold water For the filling 450g pumpkin or butternut squash 2cm piece of root ginger, peeled and sliced 2 tbsp maple syrup 275ml double cream 1 medium egg, plus an extra 2 yolks 4 tbsp dark muscovado sugar 1 tsp ground cinnamon Y, tsp finely grated nutmeg, plus extra to finish For the pastry, mix the flour, icing sugar and cinnamon together in a large bowl then add the diced butter and rub in with your fingertips until the mixture looks like fine breadcrumbs. Make a well in the centre and add the beaten egg mixed with the water. Using one hand, mix the liquid into the flour to bring the pastry together, adding a splash more water if needed. Gently knead the dough into a ball, wrap in cling film and leave to rest in the fridge for 30 minutes. Roll out the pastry on a lightly floured surface to about a 30cm circle and use to line a 23cm loose-based tart tin, 3.5cm deep,leaving a little excess overhanging the edge. Prick the base all over with a fork, then refrigerate for 15 minutes. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 200°C/Gas 6. Line the pastry case with a sheet ofbaking parchment and fill with baking beans. Bake 'blind' for 15 minutes, or until the pastry is dry to the touch and golden around the edge. Remove the beans and parchment and bake for a further 5-8 minutes, until the pastry case is crisp and golden all over. Let cool, then use a small, sharp knife to trim away the excess pastry from the edge. For the filling, peel and deseed the pumpkin or squash and cut into roughly 2cm chunks. Place in a roasting tin with the ginger, trickle over the maple syrup and toss the pumpkin to coat. Cover with foil and bake at 200°C/Gas 6 for 25 minutes, or until tender. Remove from the oven and leave to cool. Turn the oven down to 180°C/Gas 4. Tip the pumpkin, ginger and any syrup from the roasting tin into a food processor and blitz to a smooth puree. In a bowl, lightly beat the cream with the egg, extra yolks and muscovado sugar. Add the cinnamon and nutmeg then pour the mixture into the processor. Blend with the pumpkin until evenly combined. Tip the filling into the pastry case and bake for 30-35 minutes, or until just set. Leave in the tin to cool, before cutting and serving. Dust with grated nutmeg to finish. SHOWSTOPPING PIES, PUOS & CAKES 227 PECAN & PEAR TARTETATIN SERVES 6 As well as being impressive to look at, a tarte tatin is pretty straightforward to make, once you've got the knack. In this one, the pecans take on a lovely praline taste from being cooked in the caramel. Don't be afraid to cook the colour into the caramel, but don't let it go too far- there's a gap between caramelised sweetness and burnt. And make sure you tuck the pastry Plain flour, for dusting 350gready-made all-butter puff pastry For the filling 4 ripe dessert pears Juice of Y:i lemon lOOg granulated sugar 50gunsalted butter 25gpecan nuts, roughly chopped in well around the outside. Lightly dust your work surface with flour and roll out the pastry on it to a circle, 5mm thick and 28cm in diameter. Trim to neaten. Lift the pastry round onto a baking sheet and place in the fridge to rest for 30 minutes. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 220°C/ Gas 7. For the filling, peel and halve the pears, then carefully remove the core from each half. Place the pears in a bowl and toss in the lemon juice. Sprinkle the sugar in an even layer over the base of an ovenproof 24cm frying pan and set over a medium heat to melt and caramelise. Keep a close eye as the sugar will turn suddenly and, once it starts to colour, stir or move the pan around to ensure it caramelises evenly. When it is a golden caramel colour, remove the pan from the heat and stir in the butter, taking care as it is very hot and liable to splutter. Sprinkle the chopped pecans over the caramel then arrange the pear halves, cut side down, on top. Lift the chilled pastry over the top and tuck the edges around the pears inside the edge of the pan. Cut off any excess pastry. Bake for 25-30 minutes, until the pastry is crisp and golden brown. Leave the tarte tatin to stand for 5 minutes after removing from the oven, then run a knife around the edge of the pan. Protecting your hands with oven gloves, invert the tarte tatin onto a large, lipped serving plate (to hold the juices) then lift off the pan. Serve with vanilla ice cream or cream.

Turn the dish upside down and tap out any excess. Heat 250ml milk in a pan over a low heat until it is just simmering. Meanwhile, chop the chocolate into small pieces and place in a bowl. In another bowl, mix together the sugar, cornflour, 1 tbsp cocoa powder and remaining 2 tbsp milk. Pour the hot milk onto the chocolate, stirring as you do so, and continue to stir until it has melted. Pour the chocolate milk onto the cornflour and cocoa mixture and stir until evenly blended. Return to the pan and heat, stirring, until it comes to the boil. Lower the heat and cook, stirring, for a further 2-3 minutes. Put the 3 egg yolks into a medium bowl and pour on the chocolate mixture, whisking as you go. Cover the surface with cling film and leave to cool slightly (you can do this slightly in advance and let it cool to room temperature but it shouldn't be cold). Heat your oven to 190°C/Gas 5. Whisk the 4 egg whites to fairly stiff peaks. Stir a spoonful of the egg white into the chocolate mixture to loosen it, then gently fold in the rest of the egg white. Carefully tip the chocolate mixture into the prepared dish. Bake in the oven for 40-45 minutes until the souffle is risen. Dust with icing sugar and serve immediately, with single cream.

The base of vanilla and lemon flavoured custard-and- breadcrumbs is covered with jam and then crowned with meringue. -----.------------------------------~----·--.,------~,~~~·~·----------------- Unsalted butter, for greasing 100gwhite breadcrumbs (preferably 1-2 days old) 100g raspberry jam For the custard 600ml whole milk Finely pared zest of1lemon 1large egg, plus an extra 2yolks 50g caster sugar 1 tsp vanilla paste, or the seeds from 1 vanilla pod For the meringue 4large egg whites 100g caster sugar Heat your oven to 180°C/ Gas 4. Butter a llitre pie dish and spread the breadcrumbs evenly over the base. To make the custard, heat the milk slowly in a pan with the pared lemon zest until it just comes to the boil. Meanwhile, in a bowl, beat the whole egg and extra yolks with the caster sugar and vanilla paste or seeds. Remove the lemon zest from the hot milk, then pour it onto the egg mixture, whisking as you go. Carefully pour the custard over the breadcrumbs in the dish and leave to stand for about 10 minutes, then bake for 25-30 minutes or until the custard is just set. Remove from the oven. Warm the jam gently in a small pan (or in a bowl in the microwave), then spread over the set custard. For the meringue, whisk the egg whites in a clean bowl until stiff. Gradually add the sugar, a spoonful at a time, whisking well between each addition, to make a smooth, glossy meringue. Spoon the meringue on top of the pudding and return it to the oven for 15 minutes or until the meringue topping is golden brown. Serve straight away, with cream. SHOWSTOPPING PIES, PUDS & CAKES 233 CHEAT'S MANGO & PASSION FRUIT SOUFFLE SERVES 4 The beauty of this recipe is that it uses some store-cupboard ingredients to create a restaurant-looking dessert.

Tip the custard and mango puree into a bowl. Cut the passion fruit in half, then scoop out the seeds and juice into the bowl. Mix with the custard and mango puree until evenly combined. Whisk the egg whites in a clean bowl until stiff. Gradually add the 20g sugar, a spoonful at a time, whisking well between each addition, to make a smooth, glossy meringue. Gradually fold the meringue into the passion fruit and mango custard, using a large, metal spoon or spatula, until it is all incorporated. Divide the mixture between the prepared ramekins. Use a palette knife to gently smooth and level the surface of each souffle, then run your finger around the edge to lift the mixture away from the side slightly (this helps it to rise evenly). Bake for 12-15 minutes until the souffles are risen. Dust with icing sugar and serve immediately.

Scrape the seeds from the vanilla pod, using the tip of a knife or teaspoon, and add them to the milk along with the scraped-out pod. Heat gently until the milk is about to boil. Meanwhile, beat the egg yolks and sugar together in a bowl. Slowly pour the hot milk onto the egg yolk mix, whisking as you do so. Pour the custard back into the pan and cook, stirring constantly, over a low heat until it is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon; this takes about 6-7 minutes. Remove from the heat and discard the vanilla pod. Cover the surface of the custard closely with cling film to prevent a skin forming and set aside. For the poaching liquid, pour the milk and water into a saute pan, add the sugar and bring to a simmer, stirring to help dissolve the sugar. Meanwhile, for the meringues, whisk the egg whites until stiff. Add the caster sugar, a spoonful at a time, whisking well between each addition, until you have a thick, glossy meringue. Use 2 big serving spoons to shape 6large quenelles of meringue. To do so, take a heaped spoonful of meringue and pass it repeatedly between the spoons, turning and smoothing the sides as you do so. Add the meringue quenelles to the gently simmering liquor and poach gently for 8-10 minutes, turning once, until just firm to the touch. Remove the meringues from the poaching liquid with a slotted spoon, place on a tray or plate and set aside. To make the caramel, scatter the granulated sugar evenly over the base of a clean pan and heat gently until it melts and turns a golden caramel colour. Meanwhile, pour the warm custard into warmed serving bowls and sit a meringue in each portion. As soon as the caramel is ready, drizzle it over the meringues using a metal spoon, working quickly so the caramel doesn't set in the pan. Serve at once.

Line a 32 x 22cm Swiss roll tin with baking parchment and oil this very lightly. Using a hand-held electric whisk or food mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, whisk the eggs and sugar together in a large bowl until the mixture turns pale, increases in volume and is mousse-like in texture. This takes about 8-10 minutes. The mixture should be thick enough to hold a trail on the surface when the whisk is lifted. Sift the flour over the surface and carefully fold in. Finally, fold in the warm water. Carefully pour the mixture into the prepared tin, tilting the tin so it spreads out evenly and gently easing it right into the corners. Bake for 10-12 minutes, until golden and firm to the touch. Cut a sheet of baking parchment larger than the Swiss roll tin, place on a wire rack and sprinkle with the 2 tbsp sugar. Invert the sponge onto the paper, cover with a damp tea towel and leave to cool for 5 minutes. Remove the tea towel and carefully peel the paper from the sponge. Lightly score aline along the short side nearest to you, aboutlcm from the edge. Carefully roll up the sponge, folding along the score mark to make the first roll and using the paper to help. This initial roll, while the sponge is warm (before the jam is added), helps to prevent cracking. Gently unroll the sponge, cover with the damp tea towel and leave to cool a little more, until just slightly warm. Trim the edges of the sponge to neaten. Spread the jam on the sponge, leaving a 2cm margin at the edges. Roll up the sponge again, starting at the short end along the score mark again. Roll up tightly, using the paper and both hands, patting gently as you go to keep the roll compact but still airy. Trim the ends off the sponge to neaten then place the Swiss roll on a serving plate or board, with the seam underneath.

Bake for 15-20 min\\l~~s until golden and fit:m to the touch. Cut a sheet ofbakingparchmentlargerthan the Swiss roll tin and place on a wire rack. Sprinkle the parchment with sugar. Invert the cooked sponge _<:nto the parchment, cover with a damp tea towel and leave to cool completely. Meanwhile, for the filling, beat the butter in a ~owl until very soft then gradually be~t in the icing sugar to make a smooth, fluffy buttercream. Peel away the baking parchment from the sponge then trim the edges to n.eaten. Spoon the jam onto the sponge and spread it out evenly, leaving a 2cm margin around the edges.

CHOCOLATE & SALTED CARAMEL MACARONS MAKES 30 It's a technical challenge to get perfect macarons but they'll taste good even. if they don't look immaculate. The key, as with so many bakes, is to be patient. Leave the piped macarons to rest so that a slight skin forms on the top. You then bake them off, pipe your filling on the base and sandwich them together. For the chocolate paste 3large eggwhites 240g ground almonds 240g icing sugar 40g cocoa powder For the meringue 3large egg whites 240g caster sugar 1 tbsp finely chopped cocoa nibs, to finish For the salted caramel filling 150g granulated sugar 90ml double cream Y. tsp fine sea salt 30g unsalted butter Line three baking trays with baking parchment. Using a 4.5cm cutter as a guide, draw circles on the paper, leaving 2cm space in between them. Turn the paper over and place on the baking tray (so you can see the circles but the lines won't mark the macarons ). To make the chocolate paste, put the egg whites into a bowl with the ground almonds, then sift over the icing sugar and cocoa powder. Mix together to form a thick paste. To make the meringue, put the egg whites and sugar into aheatproof bowl and set over a pan of simmering water (making sure the water is not touching the bowl). Using a balloon whisk, beat the mixture thoroughly until the sugar dissolves and the mixture reaches a temperature of 65°C (as registered on a cook's thermometer). . Remove the bowl from the heat. Either transfer the mixture to'a food mixer fitted with the whisk attachment or use a hand-held electric whisk to whisk until cooled and you have a stiff, glossy meringue; this will take at least 5 minutes. -~- ,- I\" . - Gradually fold the meringue into the chocolate paste, a spoonful at a time. The mixture is stiff so this will take some effort. Spoon the mixture into a piping bag fitted with a lcm nozzle, or snip the end off a paper piping bag to create an aperture of this size. Pipe the 'mixture evenly within the marked circles on the parchment. Sprinkle half of them with the chopped cocoa nibs. Leave the macarons to stand, uncovered, for at least 30 minutes, or until a skin forms. Meanwhile, heat your oven to 150°C/Gas 2. Bake the macarons for 15 minutes, until risen and set. Leave to cool completely on the baking trays before assembling. To make the caramel, place the sugar in a small heavy-based saucepan or frying pan. Over a low heat and without stirring, gently melt the sugar until it turns a golden caramel colour. AB soon as it has ch~ged colour, slowly pour in the cream and stir, protecting your hand with an oven glove as the mixture will bubble ferociously. Keep stirring until.the cream is incorporated, then add the salt and butter. Remove the pan from the heat and st~r vigorously with a woocten spoon until the butter has melted. Leave to cool in the pan. To assemble, transfer the caramel to a small paper piping bag and snip off the end. Pipe a little salted caramel onto the plain macaron bases, leaving a clear margin around the edge. Sandwich together with the cocoa-nib-topped macarons and place ofi a serving plate . MATCHA MIRROR GLAZE GATEAU SERVES 8 Matcha, a special Japanese powdered green tea, gives this sponge a modern flavour and brilliant colour; you can find it in health food shops. Once mastered, a mirror glaze turns a home-made cake into something beautiful. It's all about the shine and you have to be careful to get rid of all the crumbs, as every little bump will show. As the white chocolate glaze is very sweet, it is balanced with mascarpone cream between the layers, rather than a sweeter buttercream. ----------------------~-.------------~----~--------~~----------------- For the Genoise sponge 125g plain flour 2 tbsp premium -grade matcha powder 4largeeggs 125g caster sugar 30gunsalted butter, melted For the filling 350g mascarpone 40ml double cream For the white chocolate mirror glaze 5g leaf gelatine (3 sheets Costa brand) 175g white chocolate (inexpensive Milky Bar works particularly well) 75mlwater 150g caster sugar lOOg condensed milk For the decoration A handful of raspberries lOg white chocolate, grated 1 tsp food -grade dried rose petals Small scrapes of gold leaf (optional) Heat your oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Grease two 18cm loose-based cake tins and line the bases with baking parchment. To make the Genoise sponge, sift the flour with the matcha and set aside. Place the eggs and sugar in a large heatproofbowl and set over a pan ofbarely simmering water, making sure the bowl isn't touching the water. Using a hand-held electric whisk, beat until the mixture is pale, tripled in volume and thickened to a mousse-like consistency. This will take around 7-8 minutes. Remove the bowl from the heat and gently fold the flour mix into the whisked mixture, a couple of tablespoonfuls at a time, using a rubber spatula or a large metal spoon. Run the spatula (or spoon) around the outside of the mixture and then through the middle to incorporate the flour and keep in as much air as possible. Pour the melted butter around the side of the bowl and carefully fold in. Divide the mixture between the prepared cake tins and bake for 15-20 minutes, until risen and the cake springs back when lightly pressed with your fingertips. Leave to cool in the tins for 5 minutes then remove and transfer to a wire rack. Leave to cool completely. To make the filling, whisk the mascarpone and cream together in a bowl until thick. To assemble the cake, use a large serrated knife to cut each sponge in halfhorizontally, turning the cake as you go (shown overleaf). Continued overleaf SH O WSTOPPIHG PIES, PUDS & CAKES 246 Place one sponge on a cake board and spread a thin layer of cream over the surface, starting in the middle and spreading outwards, then cover with another sponge disc. Repeat until you have all4 sponge layers sandwiched together. Spread the remaining cream over the top and sides of the cake to cover it completely, then use a palette knife and plastic scraper to smooth the surfaces. Any imperfections will show up once the mirror glaze is applied so take your time over this - turn the cake around as you spread the cream with the edge of the palette knife or a scraper and wipe the blade with a clean, damp cloth to keep it free of crumbs. Place the cake in the fridge for 30 minutes to chill and firm up the cream. (You want the cream to be set firm but not too cold or the mirror glaze might crack.) To make the mirror glaze, soak the gelatine leaves in a shallow dish of cold water to soften for a few minutes. Chop the white chocolate into small pieces and place three-quarters in a medium bowl. Put the water, sugar and condensed milk in a saucepan and heat, stirring occasionally, until the sugar has dissolved. Squeeze the excess water from the gelatine sheets then add them to the pan and immediately remove from the heat. Stir until the gelatine has dissolved. Pour the gelatine mixture onto the chocolate and whisk until the chocolate has melted. Add the remaining chocolate and stir to melt. Strain through a fine sieve into a jug (this helps to remove any air bubbles). Leave the glaze to cool until it is almost the consistency of condensed milk but still pourable (at about 25-27°C, but the exact temperature varies according to the brand of chocolate). To cool the mixture quickly, place the bowl in a larger bowl filled with iced water. Sit the cake on its board on a wire rack with a tray placed underneath. Carefully pour the glaze over the cake, starting at the outside edge so that it runs down over the sides and then pouring in a circular motion towards the middle. Some of the glaze will run off the sides but if it is too fluid leave it to cool for a little longer. Make sure the sides of the cake are covered, as well as the top. Leave for a few minutes to allow the glaze to set on the cake then chill in the fridge for an hour. Decorate the top of the cake with raspberries, grated white chocolate, dried rose petals and, if you like, some scrapes of gold leaf. SHOWSTOPPING PIES, PUDS & CAKES 249 WHENEVER YOU THINK OF A CELEBRATION- a birthday, wedding, anniversary or Christmas- it has symbols attached. These always include a bake. Birthdays mean birthday cake, with everyone sitting round and the candles to blow out. I've made many cakes for my lad Josh growing up. He likes chocolate cake and some years it is covered in his favourite sweets. I make sure the cake is good, make a lovely ganache and cover it in Milky Bars or whatever he wants. It's fine to go out and buy a novelty cake, but a cake made by family or friends is always best. Or take Easter. It makes me think of hot cross buns and Simnel cake. I love the marzipan on a Simnel cake, but in some ways it's the tradition of making that cake at that time which matters. Then there's Christmas cake. I like heavily fruited cakes with the crunch of royal icing, even though I'm full after dinner. The story of a wedding cake goes back hundreds of years. When Queen Victoria married Albert, they had a big tiered cake covered in white icing and that is when it became known as 'royal icing'. Such special cakes have always been about showing off skills and, most of all, sharing. If you can get people around a table with a bake central to that- a bread, a cake or pastries, it's a way of communicating, enjoying what you eat and share. Celebration cakes and bakes are often nostalgic because they are rooted in tradition and that's something we're very good at in this country. We have a long history ofbaking that has been passed down generation to generation. Every family has a go-to cake and with a bit of effort, even an everyday bake can be turned into something special- by decorating it and making it personal to you. If you know how to make a simple tea loaf, then you can make a round one and cover it with marzipan; decorate it with icing and put a bride and groom on the top and you'll have a straightforward wedding cake. CELEBRATIONS 252 One of the first cakes that most people ever make is a Victoria sandwich. Mix it together, bung it in a tin and bake it. I like to put cream in the filling- this goes against the rules for some, I know, but cream and cherry jam it is for me. I put the jam in first and pipe cream on top of the jam in concentric circles. I also like to put plenty of icing sugar on top of the cake. You can heat skewers over a gas flame and press them on to burn the icing sugar and make a criss-cross pattern. Or decorate the cake with a pile or rasp berries or cherries, the same flavour as the jam. All such ideas take the cake to another level. Decoration needn't be elaborate. You can make a simple ganache (using a decent amount of chocolate and cream and a little bit ofbutter), pour it on and leave it to set. Melt some white chocolate and spin that over, then fan some strawberries over the top to finish. You've gone from a £5 to a £25 cake, with the minimum of effort and outlay. Always remember that a cake at a celebration can be the main event or the finale at the end of the meal; it's often what you remember, so make it good. People can go overboard when it comes to decoration; I, for one, don't know when to stop. I love manipulating sugar paste. One year, I made a Christmas cake featuring mice in bed. The Christmas cake was the bed and the marzipan was the duvet and then I put sugar paste around the outside. There were twelve mice in the bed and I set the whole cake in a box, painting the walls with chocolate and making chocolate floorboards marked with toothpicks to get little knots. I put a sugar paste rug next to the bed and twelve pairs of slippers. Then I used sugar paste for Father Christmas's footprints to a fireplace, which I'd filled with chocolate sticks. I painted a picture of mice on the walls. There were stockings hanging on the bed post and toys spilling out from them onto the floor, all made with coloured sugar paste. By the time I'd finished, I'd set up a scene that wouldn't be out of place in Wallace and Gromit. CELEBRATIONS 253 Imagination is key. Take inspiration from things you like. If you can model something in Plasticine, you can do it in sugar paste. It's like sculpture- you just have to think in a three- dimensional way. There are lots of templates you can buy these days, or draw your own, copying or tracing over an image to help. I generally recommend baking a Madeira sponge for novelty cakes and large scale celebration cakes- so I've given a recipe in this chapter. It tastes good, is easy to cut and acts as a great base for other flavours and for your decorations. A whisked sponge would concertina down under even a slight amount of weight, but a Madeira will take icing, fruit, whatever you want. It's also important to use ingredients that will keep. Such cakes take time to make and you need to do them in advance of a big occasion, so use buttercream rather than fresh cream, for example. For big occasions, I have created two stunning celebration cakes. Royal icing has fallen from fashion, in terms ofhome baking, but I love this tradition and show you how to ice a cake in this way on pages 286-9, giving the tips of a professional. When you are piping, don't overfill the icing bag. Hold the bag at the top, rolling it down as you go so you don't get air bubbles. Keep the nozzle close to the cake, for more control, and don't push out the icing too fast- work smoothly and steadily. As well as a royal iced cake, I've given a recipe for a naked celebration cake, using a meringue-based icing that is scraped away to reveal part of the cake. The style is informal but the cake is modern and beautiful. The recipes in this chapter are for celebrations with family and friends, when we want to push the boat out. Some are more straightforward, and some are my personal take on classics such as creme brule e. Others, like the gingerbread house, take time. But, of course, you can simplify the decorations if you like; that applies to the other recipes in this chapter too. Whether you go to town or keep it simple, these bakes will lift a special occasion. CELEBRATIONS 255 ···v·· . -· - ----./ / . ' i / I / / ~ / ( ' .

To decorate, using a fine brush, paint the edges of the cookies with egg white, then dust generously with icing sugar. Shake off the excess icing sugar to leave a decorative outline. CELEBRATIONS 258 GINGERBREAD HOUSE SERVES1S Every Christmas we go away to France for a family holiday and do a chalet baking competition with other families. Each team gets a gingerbread house to decorate in an hour and I'm the judge, of course! The house will last about a week or so, over Christmas. You find the roof tiles- chocolate buttons or Smarties- tend to get eaten first; then the Flake chimney goes, and then people start snapping bits and pieces off all over the place. For the dough 500g plain flour, plus extra for dusting 2 tsp bicarbonate of soda 2 tsp ground cinnamon 2 tsp ground ginger 1 tsp ground cloves 200g cold unsalted butter, cut into small dice 175g caster sugar 2 medium eggs 150g golden syrup 150g black treacle For the decoration 9 boiled sweets (ideally red or yellow), crushed using a pestle and mortar (or a spice or coffee grinder or small food processor) 500g royal icing sugar, plus extra for optional icicles 6tbspwater 200g giant chocolate buttons 75g apricot jam 75g desiccated coconut 9 chocolate Flake bars To assemble A rectangular cake board, at least 25 x 18cm Start by cutting out the templates for your gingerbread house. You will need to make three paper or card templates: a rectangular side wall (18 x 10cm); arectangularroof(19 x 12cm); and amain wall with a triangular gable top (base 18cm, sides 18cm and then sloping into a triangular gable 29cm from base to apex). You will use these to make two side walls, two roof pieces, a front wall and a back wall. To make the dough, in a large bowl, mix the flour, bicarbonate of soda and spices together. Add the butter and rub in with your fingertips until the mixture resembles fine breadcrumbs, then stir in the sugar. In another large bowl, mix the eggs with the golden syrup and treacle. Add the flour mixture and mix to combine and form a soft dough. Transfer the dough to a lightly floured work surface and knead until smooth. Wrap in cling film and refrigerate for at least 1 hour. Heat your oven to 180°C/Gas 4 and line four baking trays with baking parchment. Halve the dough, then divide one half into one-third and two-thirds. Roll out each piece on a lightly floured surface to a 4mm thickness. Using the templates, cut out a front wall and a back wall from the largest piece, two side walls from the smallest piece, and two roof pieces from the other (medium) piece. Cut out two 4cm square windows from the side walls. Cut an 8 x Scm door and a Scm circular window in the front wall. (Keep the cut-out door.) Lift the pieces onto the prepared baking trays, placing the front and side walls on two trays, and the roof pieces, back wall and cut-out door on the other two trays. Bake for 8 minutes, then take out the trays containing the front and side walls. Trim the windows with a knife, or use a cutter, to remove the dough that has spread, then fill with CELEBRATIONS 260 crushed sweets. Return to the oven for 7 minutes until the sweets have melted to resemble coloured glass and the gingerbread is firm. Remove the trays containing the roof pieces, back wall and door after they've been in the oven for 15 minutes, or when they are firm. Leave the pieces of gingerbread to cool on the baking trays for 5- 10 minutes to firm up, then transfer to wire racks to cool completely. Mix 250g of the royal icing sugar with 3 tbsp water to make a thick pipeable icing and put into a piping bag fitted with a writing nozzle. Pipe the decoration of your choice onto the walls. Pipe parallellines of icing on the roof and stick on the chocolate buttons, overlapping them slightly to resemble tiles. You can also pipe semi -circles of icing on each button for extra 'snow'. Leave the walls and roof to set for at least 10 hours, or overnight. To assemble the house, have your cake board ready. Heat the apricot jam with a little water, then brush over the cake board. Cover with the desiccated coconut so it looks like snow. Mix the remaining royal icing sugar and water to a thick paste. Pipe icing on the base and sides of the front wall. Use a mug as a prop and stand the front wall against it so that it remains upright and sticks to the cake board. Pipe icing along the sides and base of the other three walls. Place them firmly on the cake board and join the edges together to make a house, using more icing as needed to fill any gaps. As you go, use icing to stick 3 Flakes on the inside base of the house, against each wall (except the front wall with the door); also stick 4 Flakes upright on the corners to act as supports. Attach the front door with icing. Leave to set for at least 10 hours or overnight before attaching the roof, storing the spare icing in an airtight container. You can attach both roof pieces at once but it is easier to do this in two stages, leaving time for setting in between. Pipe a generous amount of icing on the top edge of one side wall and the front and back gable on the same side of the house. Use icing to attach a Flake to the top inside of that side wall to act as a support. Pipe icing on the edge of one roof piece and attach it to the house. Use a large glass (such as a pint glass) to prop it up until the icing sets. Leave to set for at least 5 hours, ideally overnight; store the spare icing in an airtight container. Attach the other roof piece in the same way and leave to set. To finish, pipe icicles along the roof edges, using more icing, if you like. Photographs overleaf CELEBRATIONS 261 GLUTEN-FREE VICTORIA SANDWICH SERVES 8 I do baking demos around the country these days, and I've found that someone will always ask about gluten-free alternatives. The key to the best gluten-free flour is to mix different kinds together as they all have different qualities. The texture of this cake isn't quite as soft as a regular Victoria sandwich; it's more like a Madeira cake and tastes great. 225gunsalted butter, softened, plus extra for greasing BOg white rice flour 50g quinoa flour 50g tapioca flour 50g coconut flour 2 tsp baking power 1 tsp xanthan gum 225g caster sugar 4 medium eggs To finish lOOg raspberry jam 150g whipping cream Icing or caster sugar, for dusting Heat your oven to 180°C/ Gas 4. Grease the base and sides of two 20cm loose-based cake tins and line the bases with baking parchment. Sift all the flours together with the baking powder and xanthan gum into a bowl. In another large bowl, beat the butter and sugar together until light and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition and scraping down the sides of the bowl with a spatula. Add the flour mixture and fold in, using the spatula or a large metal spoon until just fully incorporated. Divide the mixture between the prepared cake tins and gently smooth the surface with a palette knife to level. Bake in the centre of the oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the sponges are risen, golden and slightly shrunk from the sides of the tins. Leave in the tins for a few minutes, then remove and place on a wire rack to cool completely. Choose the best-looking sponge for the top layer and then lay the other one, top side down, on your serving dish. Spread the jam over this bottom layer. Whip the cream in a bowl to soft peaks and spread on top of the jam then place the other cake layer on top. Dust with sifted icing or caster sugar to finish.

Bake for 20 minutes, or until the cakes are risen and spring back when lightly pressed with the fingers. Leave in the tins for 5 minutes, then remove and place on a wire rack to cool completely. To make the ganache topping, chop the chocolate into small pieces and place in a bowl with the butter. Gently heat the cream in a pan until it just begins to boil, then pour onto the chocolate and butter and stir until they have melted to form a smooth, shiny chocolate ganache. Leave to cool and thicken, until set but still spreadable. To make the filling, beat the butter, cocoa powder and icing sugar together in a bowl, adding enough milk to make a smooth chocolate buttercream with a spreadable consistency. To assemble, choose the best-looking sponge for the top layer and then lay the other one, top side down, on your serving plate. Spread with the chocolate buttercream then place the other sponge on top to sandwich the two layers together. Using a palette knife, spread the chocolate ganache over the top of the cake, starting in the middle and working out towards the edges. Serve for tea, or with cream or ice cream as a birthday dessert.

Place the cake on a plate or cake stand and spread the topping evenly over the surface. Sprinkle with the desiccated coconut to finish. CELEBRATIONS 269 CHOCOLATE & MINT BUNDTCAKE SERVES12 I've used royal icing for the finish on this as it sets better than regular icing and stays in the grooves of the bundt cake. This recipe is for my mum, to make up for the time I ate all the After Eights I bought her as a present when I was a kid. I still love the chocolate and mint combination just as much as ever. 275g unsalted butter or margarine, softened, plus extra for greasing 275g caster sugar 2largeeggs 225g self-raising flour 50g cocoa powder For the mint icing lOOg royal icing sugar Y. tsp peppermint extract 4-5 tsp water 6 After Eight mints, halved on the diagonal Heat your oven to 180°C/Gas 4. Butter a 2.4litre bundt tin. Place the butter or margarine and sugar in a food mixer fitted with the whisk attachment and beat together until pale and fluffy (or use a hand-held electric whisk and a large bowl). Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well. Mix the flour and cocoa powder together, then add to the mixer on a slow speed and continue to mix for 2 minutes until evenly combined. Use a spatula to scrape down the sides of the bowl a couple of times as you go. Spoon the cake mixture into the bundt tin and smooth the surface to level. Bake for 45-50 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the deepest part of the cake comes out clean. Leave the cake to cool in the tin for 10 minutes, then turn it out and place on a wire rack to cool completely. For the mint icing, put the icing sugar into a bowl, add the peppermint extract and 1 tbsp water and mix together, then beat with a hand-held electric whisk until smooth and glossy. The icing should only just be able to run off a spoon: it must not be too thin; if it is too thick, add another 1-2 tsp water if necessary. Place a tray under the wire cooling rack. Pour the mint icing along the grooves of the cake. Decorate with halved After Eight mints to finish. CELEBRATIONS 271 ... . • J . .. -· .... ·. ;· . .

A BLACK FOREST GATEAU SERVES12 In Germany, you can't become a konditor meister, or master patissier, until you can make a Black Forest gateau correctly. For me it's all about the chocolate, the cherries and the kirsch. For the sponge 200g unsalted butter, softened, plus extra for greasing 200g caster sugar 6large eggs, separated 130g self-raising flour 70g cocoa powder 3tbspmilk For the filling and topping 3 tbsp kirsch 4 tbsp cherry jam 900ml double cream, whipped 400gtin pitted black cherries, drained and halved (about 260g drained weight) To decorate 60g dark chocolate (60-70% cocoa solids), finely grated A handful of fresh cherries Heat your oven to 180°C/ Gas 4. Grease the base and sides of a 23cm springform cake tin and line the base with baking parchment. Beat the butter and sugar together in a large bowl, using a hand-held electric whisk, until the mixture is pale and fluffy. Beat in the egg yolks one at a time. Sift the flour and cocoa powder together into another bowl, then fold into the whisked mixture, using a large metal spoon. Finally fold in the milk. In a clean bowl, whisk the egg whites to soft peaks. Gradually fold into the chocolate mixture, a spoonful at a time, until fully incorporated. Pour the mixture into the prepared tin and gently level the surface. Bake in the centre of the oven for 45-50 minutes, or until a skewer inserted into the middle comes out clean. Leave the cake in the tin for 5 minutes, then turn out and place on a wire rack to cool completely. When you are ready to assemble the gateau, using a large, serrated knife, carefully cut the cake horizontally into three even layers. (Keep the knife horizontal and straight, moving the cake around as you cut and keeping one hand lightly on top.) Place one sponge disc on your serving plate and sprinkle evenly with 1 \\-'2 tbsp kirsch. Spread half of the cherry jam over the sponge, then apply a layer of whipped cream, dolloping it on the cake and spreading it out with a palette knife. Scatter over half of the cherries. Place the middle layer of sponge on top, sprinkle with the rest of the kirsch, then repeat the jam, cream and cherry layers. Place the third sponge disc on top. Load a palette knife with cream. Starting from the middle and working outwards, spread cream all over the top and the sides to cover the entire cake in a thin layer of cream. Press grated chocolate around the sides and dust the top with more chocolate. Pipe rosettes of cream around the edge of the cake and sit whole cherries on the rosettes. CELEBRATIONS 275 ' A # LIQUORICE CREME BRULEE SERVES 4 Creme bnilee was the first thing I made for my mum when I was around seventeen, along with roast chicken. She thought it was very smart. I love that moment when you crack through the caramel and get to the soft, creamy custard. This one is flavoured with liquorice, one of my favourite sweets from a local shop in Wallaseywhen I was growing up. 350ml double cream 250ml whole milk 1 vanilla pod, split lengthways 125g soft natural liquorice 5large egg yolks 3 tbsp caster sugar For the brillee topping 4 tbsp caster sugar 4 tbsp icing sugar Heat your oven to 160°C/Gas 3. Stand four shallow ramekins, about 200ml capacity and lOcm in diameter, in a roasting tin. Pour the cream and milk into a pan. Scrape the seeds from the vanilla pod, using the tip of a knife or teaspoon, and add them to the milk along with the scraped-out pod. Chop the liquorice into small pieces and add to the pan. Heat gently until the creamy milk is just coming to the boil, stirring so the liquorice partially melts, infusing the liquid with flavour and adding colour. Remove from the heat. In a bowl, whisk the egg yolks with the caster sugar for 2-3 minutes, until the mixture is smooth and turns a little paler in colour. Strain the hot infused milk onto the whisked mixture, stirring as you do so. Pour the custard mixture into the ramekins, dividing it equally. Pour water into the roasting tin until it comes halfway up the side of the ramekins. Cook in the oven for 40-45 minutes, or until the custards are set but still have a slight wobble in the middle. Remove the ramekins from the roasting tin, cover with cling film and leave to cool completely. Refrigerate until required. When you are ready to serve, sprinkle the surface of each brulee with 1 tbsp caster sugar and then sift 1 tbsp icing sugar on top (the icing sugar gives shine and the sugar lends crunch). Caramelise the surface using a cook's blowtorch. Altematively, place under a preheated hot grill, about 5cm from the heat source, until the sugar melts and turns a deep golden colour (about 7-9 minutes, depending on your grill). Leave the caramel to set and harden for about 5 minutes before serving. CELEBRATIONS 276 BAKED A SKA SERVES 8 I was introduced to baked Alaska by my mother-in-law, who is really good at making it. There's a cold ice-cream interior with a coating of meringue, and it's flashed in the oven to colour the meringue. It shouldn't work but it does. For the sponge base 125gunsalted butter, softened, plus extra for greasing 125g caster sugar 2 medium e~gs lOOg self-raising flour 25g cocoa powder For the ice cream fill g 500g chocolate brownie ice cream 300g salted caramel ice cream .i' r e me ;ng•t 3 medium egg whites Y. tsp cream of tartar 175g caster sugar Heat your oven to 190°C/Gas 5. Grease the base and sides of a 20cm loose-based cake tin and line the base with baking parchment. In a large bowl, beat the butter and sugar together until pale and fluffy. Add the eggs, one at a time, beating well after each addition. Sift the flour and cocoa powder together over the mixture and fold in, using a large metal spoon. Spread the mixture in the prepared tin- this is a stiff mixture to make a firm sponge base. Bake for 20-25 minutes until the sponge is risen and springs back when lightly pressed. Leave the cake in the tin for 10 minutes, then remove and place on a wire rack to cool completely. Take the chocolate ice cream out of the freezer so it softens slightly while the cake cools (about 30 minutes) . Line a 900ml pudding basin with cling film. Beat the chocolate ice cream with a spoon until soft, to make it easier to manipulate. Spread the ice cream over the base and sides of the basin to form an even layer. Cover with cling film and sit a smaller bowl in the centre (to create a hollow in the middle). Place in the freezer just long enough for the ice cream to set - about 1-1 Y2 hours, depending on your freezer. Meanwhile, take the salted caramel ice cream out of the freezer so it softens slightly (about 30 minutes). Take the chocolate ice cream from the freezer and remove the smaller bowl and cling film around it. Beat the softened salted caramelice cream with a spoon, then spoon into the hollow in the centre of the chocolate ice cream. Cover with cling film, return to the freezer and leave to freeze completely- about 1-1 Y2 hours. --- - -- ------------------------------- Heat your oven to 220°C/Gas 7. To make the meringue, whisk the egg whites in a clean bowl to stiff peaks. Add the cream oftartar, with a spoonful of the sugar, and whisk to combine. Continue to whisk in the sugar a spoonful at a time, until it is all incorporated and you have a thick, glossy meringue. Place the chocolate sponge in the middle of a baking sheet. Remove the ice cream bombe from the bowl, pulling on the cling film lining to help ease it out. Sit the ice cream, flat side down, on the sponge and remove the cling film. Spread the meringue over the ice cream to cover it and the sponge base completely. Place in the oven for 3-4 minutes until the meringue is just beginning to brown. Slide the baked Alaska onto a large plate and serve immediately. BASIC MADEIRA CAKE MAKES 40 - 60 SLICES (ONCE ICED) Madeira has more of a chew than a Victoria sandwich sponge and is the best cake to use as the basis for a celebration cake. Cakes for special occasions are often decorated beautifully but the cake inside can often be disappointing. This recipe delivers every time. When making large cakes it is much easier to use a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, if you have one. The following recipe is used to make the two tiered celebration cakes on the pages that follow. For the 15cm cake 165g self-raising flour llOg caster sugar llOg soft tub margarine, plus extra for greasing 2 medium eggs ltbspmilk For the 23cm cake 450g self-raising flour 400g caster sugar 400g soft tub margarine, plus extra for greasing 7 medium eggs 3tbspmilk Heat your oven to 150°C/ Gas 2. Grease the base and sides of a 15cm and a 23cm deep loose-based cake tin and line the base and sides ofboth tins with baking parchment. Put all the ingredients for the 15cm cake in a food mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and start mixing on the lowest speed to combine the ingredients. Then increase the speed and mix for about 1 minute until the mixture is smooth and pale in colour. Pour into the lined tin and smooth the top to level. Use the same method to prepare the larger cake. You can cook the cakes together, ideally on the same shelf in the centre of the oven. Allow about 1 hour for the smaller cake, about 1% hours for the larger cake; do not open the door to check the smaller cake before 55 minutes. The cakes should be risen, lightly golden and spring back when pressed gently. To test, insert a skewer into the centre of the cake: it should come out clean. If not, continue baking for a further 5-10 minutes. When each cake is ready, remove from the oven and leave to cool in the tin for 5 minutes, then turn out and place on a wire rack. Leave to cool completely. CELEBRATIONS 281 CLASSIC ICED CELEBRATION CAKE MAKES ABOUT 60 SLICES This simple, elegant cake is ideal for a wedding, christening or other celebration. For a professional finish, invest in a few items of equipment from a specialist cake supplier - a turntable, a plastic scraper, an icing smoother and a straight-edge rule. You'll also need a non -stick rolling pin, small piping bags and 2mm and 3mm piping nozzles (i.e. sizes 3 and 5). As for timing, if the celebration is on a Saturday, bake the cake on the Monday, marzipan it on the Tuesday and royal ice on the Wednesday. Apply the sugar paste on the Thursday and pipe the finishing touches on the Friday. Position any fresh flowers at the last minute. 1 x 15cm Madeira cake 1 x 23cm Madeira cake (see page 281) For the royal icing 50ml cold water 2 tsp dried egg white powder 260g icing sugar (regular not royal), sifted For the buttercream 250gunsalted butter, softened 400g sifted icing sugar (regular, not royal) About 1 tbsp rose water, to taste To assemble and decorate 1.5kg natural marzipan 1.75kg sugar paste or ready-to-roll icing (in your chosen colour) Gel food colouring (in your chosen colour) Fresh flowers (optional) To make the royal icing, put the water into a bowl, add the egg white powder and whisk until dissolved to form to a milky, lump-free liquid. (Using powdered instead ofliquid egg white gives the icing lightness.) Pour the egg white liquid into a food mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and add half the icing sugar. Mix on a slow speed to combine and then add the remaining icing sugar, a spoonful at a time, until you have the consistency of soft whipped cream. Increase the speed to medium and beat until the mixture doubles in volume and turns glossy; this will take about 5 minutes. Now beat on the fastest setting for 2 minutes until the icing is fluffy. Transfer to a bowl, cover with a clean damp cloth and set aside until ready to use. To make the buttercream, beat the butter using a hand-held electric whisk until very soft. Gradually add the icing sugar, mixing on a slow speed until it is all incorporated. Then increase the speed and beat until fluffy and paler in colour. The buttercream needs to be quite stiff otherwise the cake layers will move. Flavour with rose water, to taste. To assemble, place the cakes on a work surface and, using a large serrated knife, carefully trim off the top of each so they are level. Cut each cake in halfhorizontally, using the knife. Spread a thin, even layer ofbuttercream (about 5mm thick) over the bottom half of the 23cm cake, then position the other half on top. Sandwich the 15cm cake together with buttercream in the same way. Continued overleaf CELEBRATIONS 282 Items for assembly Two 30cm round cake drum boards 13cm round single- thickness card 1.7 metres ribbon (to go around the 23cm cake and 30cm board) Double-sided tape (to stick the ribbon on) TO APPLY THE MARZIPAN Knead 500g marzipan into a smooth ball and roll out on a surface lightly dusted with icing sugar to a circle, about 27cm in diameter, turning it as you roll to prevent it sticking and using just enough icing sugar to keep it moving. Make sure the marzipan is an even thickness and that it moves freely and is not sticking to the work surface. Spread a fine, even layer ofbuttercream over the top of the larger cake (to stick the marzipan to the cake). Invert the cake onto the centre of the marzipan round. Push the edge of the marzipan towards the edge of the cake then trim away all but 2mm marzipan. Using the straight edge of the scraper, push the excess 2mm marzipan so it is flush with the sides of the cake. Slide the cake to the edge of the work surface, turn it over and place on a 30cm drum board so the marzipan is on top and level. Clean the work surface. Take another 500g marzipan to cover the sides and knead to soften then shape into a cylinder. Dust the work surface with icing sugar to prevent sticking and roll ~e marzipan out to a rectangle, 75 x 12cm and 5mm thick. Trim the short ends and one long side to straighten. Spread the sides of the cake with a thin layer ofbuttercream, wiping the palette knife clean as you go to prevent crumbs going into the buttercream. Lift the cake from the board, easing it up with the palette knife. Place the cake on its side so the straight edge of the marzipan is at the top. Roll the cake along the marzipan strip to cover the side. Lightly dust the work surface with icing sugar and place the cake on it, marzipan-covered top down. Push the two ends of the marzipan strip together and rub to smooth the join. Using a sharp knife and a short, sawing motion, trim off the excess marzipan from the uppermost bottom edge of the cake, making sure the blade is flat onto the cake, not at an angle. Put a blob of royal icing in the centre of the drum board (to help the cake stay in position). Slide the cake to the edge of your work surface, turn it over and place back on the drum board. Brush away any excess icing sugar. You should have a level, smooth cake. Spread a thin layer ofbuttercream on top of the smaller cake and cover with marzipan in the same way, but roll out 250g marzipan to a 19cm circle for the top and 250g marzipan into a 45 x 12cm strip, 5mm thick, for the side. Spread a thin layer ofbuttercream on the base of the smaller cake and stick on the 13cm piece of card. Turn the cake over so the base is on the bottom and the marzipan on top. Place the cake on the loose base of a cake tin slightly larger than the cake (this helps when moving it). Continued overleaf CELEBRATI ON S 285 TO APPLY THE ROYAL ICING Place the larger cake on a turntable. Load one side of the palette knife with royal icing and spread on top of the cake from the centre outwards to form a smooth layer, rotating the turntable as you go. Transfer the cake on its board to the work surface. Wipe a straight- edge rule with a damp cloth and hold it at a 45° angle, sloping towards you. Starting at the far side and keeping the toollevel on the top ofthe cake, in one movement pull the straight edge across the cake towards you, then turn it so that it slopes away from you and repeat, this time pushing the straight edge to the back of the cake until the icing is smooth. It can take two or three goes to getthe icing smooth and level. Wipe the palette knife with a damp cloth and hold the blade fiat against the icing to scoop off any excess in small sections, wiping the knife clean between each stroke. Load one side of the palette knife with royal icing and spread it around the sides of the cake, keeping the knife upright and fiat against the cake. Try not to overlap with the top of the cake. Wipe the scraper with a damp cloth. Return the cake to the turntable. Holding the turntable with the other hand and starting at 12 o'clock, smooth the icing around the side in sections. Keep turning the cake towards your position at 6 o'clock, keeping the scraper fiat against the sides at all times. Now, in one movement, use a clean scraper to give a smooth finish on the side, starting at 12 o'clock and rotating and scraping the side as the cake goes around 360°. Use a palette knife to gently scrape off the icing where the sides meet the top. Remove any excess from the base. Repeat to coat the smaller cake with royal icing. Leave, uncovered, overnight to dry and set. Store any spare icing in an airtight container. TO COVER THE BOARD WITH SUGAR PASTE To cover the (unused) drum board, take 250g sugar paste and knead on a clean surface until smooth. Roll out on a surface lightly dusted with icing sugar until slightly larger than the board. Use your icing smoother to rub the surface of the paste and give it a shine. Wipe the drum board with a damp cloth (this is enough to stick on the sugar paste). Slide your fingers under the sugar paste and in one movement lift it onto the drum board. Trim any excess from the edge. Smooth the edges with your fingers where the paste meets the edge of the board. Leave, uncovered, overnight to set. TO COVER THE CAKE WITH SUGAR PASTE Take the larger cake and trim the edge of the top icing, using a sharp knife. Take 1kg sugar paste and knead into a smooth ball. Lightly dust Continued overleaf CELEBRATIONS 286 I I I r I ' r I I r f the work surface with icing sugar and roll out the sugar paste on it to a large circle, 38cm in diameter and 5mm thick, keeping the sugar paste moving. If any air bubbles appear on the surface, prick them with a needle then rub over with the smoother. Wipe the top and sides of the cake with a clean damp cloth to barely dampen the surface of the royal icing (this will enable the sugar paste to stick). Dry your hands then lift the sugar paste and position over the cake. Starting on top, smooth out the icing then gently ease it down and around the side of the cake, using the palms of your hands to smooth it as you go. Trim the excess paste from the bottom edge of the cake. Take your smoother and quickly but gently buff the top and sides of the cake, going back and forth (just as you would buff shoes). This will give straight sides and ease out any blemishes in the sugar paste. Trim the bottom edge as neatly and as close to the cake as possible. Cover the smaller cake with sugar paste in the same way, using 500g sugar paste and rolling it outto a 32cm circle. Leave to set overnight. TO ASSEMBLE AND FINISH Take the sugar-paste covered drum board, spread a little royal icing on the centre and lift the large cake (off its board) on to this covered drum board. Spread a little royal icing on top of the large cake and position the small cake (on its card) on top. Place on the turntable. Spread the remaining royal icing on a work surface or board to remove any air bubbles and make it smooth. Add a little colouring and stir in using a cocktail stick until it is a similar shade to the sugar paste. Put some of the coloured icing into a small piping bag fitted with a 2mm (size 3) nozzle, being careful not to overload it as this makes it harder to control. Pipe two rows of small balls onto the icing around the side of the smaller cake. To do this, place the nozzle on the cake and squeeze the bag to form the ball, then stop squeezing and twist the bag away from the cake. You may find there is a peak on the ball. To remove this use a fine, damp paintbrush to wipe away. Put some more coloured icing into a small piping bag fitted with a 3mm (size 5) nozzle. Angle the bag and pipe a row ofballs where the small cake meets the large cake in order to cover the join. Attach rib bon around the base of the cake, using a little icing (overlap the ends slightly). Attach ribbon around the edge of the drum board using double-sided tape. Decorate the cake with flowers if you wish. To cut the cake, lift the smaller cake off the larger one, then use a large, serrated knife to cut each cake into small slices. Wipe the knife with a clean, damp cloth after each cut, to get clean slices without crumbs. CELEBRATIONS 289 NUDE MERINGUE FINISH CELEBRATION CAKE MAKES ABOUT 40 SLICES Just as in fashion, there are trends in baking and cakes. Currently nude cakes are in vogue, where you can see the cake through the icing and the finish isn't as precise as for iced cakes. The proportions of the cake are also deeper than is traditional, usually one and a halftimes the depth ofa cake tin. To achieve this you need to make one and a half cakes in each size and sandwich them together. For a really good finish, you'll need a turntable and a plastic scraper. This icing will last up to 2 days. Do not put the iced cake in the fridge. For the 15cm cake 165g self-raising flour llOg caster sugar llOg soft tub margarine, plus extra for greasing 2 medium eggs ltbspmilk For the 23cm cake 450g self-raising flour 400g caster sugar 400g soft tub margarine, plus extra for greasing 7 medium eggs 3tbspmilk For the half-depth 15cmcake 90g self-raising flour 60g caster sugar 60g soft tub margarine lmediumegg l Y. tspmilk For the half-depth 23cmcake 225g self-raising flour 200g caster sugar 200g soft tub margarine 3 medium eggs 2tbspmilk Heat your oven to 150°C/Gas 2. Grease the base and sides of two 15cm and two 23cm deep loose-based cake tins and line the bases and sides ofboth tins with baking parchment. (Or you can manage with one of each sized tin, re-greasing and lining to bake the half-size cakes.) For each of the full-size cakes and the half-size 23cm cake, it is best to use a food mixer fitted with the paddle attachment. Place all the ingredients for the particular cake in the mixer and start mixing on the lowest speed to combine. Then increase the speed and mix for about 1 minute until the mixture is smooth and pale in colour. Pour into the lined tin and smooth the top to level. For the half-size 15cm cake, place all the ingredients in a large bowl and mix together with a hand-held electric whisk, until smooth and combined. Pour into the lined tin and smooth the surface to level. You can cook two cakes at the same time, ideally on the same shelf in the centre of the oven, but don't open the oven until near the end of the cooking time for the smaller one. Allow about 1 hour for the full- size 15cm cake and about 1% hours for the full-size 23cm cake. Allow 35-40 minutes for the half-size 15cm cake and 45-50 minutes for the half-size 23cm cake. The cakes should be risen, light golden and spring back when pressed gently. To test, insert a skewer into the centre: it should come out clean; if it doesn't, bake for a further 5-10 minutes. When ready, take the cakes from the oven and leave to cool in the tin for 5 minutes, then turn out and place on a wire rack to cool completely. Continued overleaf CELEBRATIONS 290 For the filling 300g good-quality jam (ideally a tart flavour such as raspberry or damson) For the meringue frosting lOOml cold water 4 tsp dried egg white powder 500g icing sugar, sifted For the decoration Fresh flowers and foliage To assemble 30cm cake drum board 16cm round single- thickness card Double-sided tape 1 metre ribbon (to go around the 30cm board) For the meringue frosting, put the water into a bowl, add the egg white powder and whisk until dissolved to form a milky, lump-free liquid. Pour into a food mixer fitted with the paddle attachment and add half the icing sugar. Mix on a slow speed to combine, then incorporate the remaining icing sugar, a spoonful at a time, until the icing is the consistency of soft whipped cream. Increase the speed to medium and beat until the mixture doubles in volume and turns glossy; this will take about 5 minutes. Beat on the fastest setting for 2 minutes until the icing is fluffy. Transfer to a bowl and cover with a damp cloth. Trim all the cakes level, using a serrated knife, then cut both deep cakes in halfhorizontally. To assemble, spread a layer of jam on the bottom half of the deep 23cm cake and sandwich together with the other half, pressing the top down firmly. Spread with another layer of jam and place the half-size 23cm cake on top with the base uppermost, creating a three-layer cake. Place in the centre of the 30cm drum board. Repeat the sandwiching process with the 15cm cake, using the rest of the jam. Putl tsp of the meringue mix in the middle of the 16cm round of card and sit the cake on top; the meringue will prevent the cake moving. Place centrally on the larger cake to check that the layers are level then lift off and position the smaller cake on the loose base of a cake tin (this is to help when moving the cake). Use a dry pastry brush to remove any excess crumbs from the cakes. Place the 23cm cake on the turntable. Place a quarter of the meringue on top of the cake and spread it out using a palette knife, working from the centre outwards. Don't worry if the meringue goes down the sides. Try not to touch the cake with your palette knife, only the meringue. Load one side of the palette knife with more meringue and gently ease in sections over the side of the cake until all of it is covered, icing the section of the cake in front of you and rotating the turntable as you go. Take your plastic scraper and use it to remove excess meringue from the side to give the cake an irregular finish; you should be able to see the sponge in places. Repeat this with the smaller cake, making sure you cover the edges where the cake meets the card. Use a palette knife to lift the cake and remove the loose cake base. Sit the smaller cake on the larger cake. Use a cook's blowtorch to brown the meringue in patches, moving the flame all the time and taking care not to burn the icing. Attach the ribbon around the drum board using double-sided tape. Decorate the cake with fresh flowers and foliage. CELEBRATIONS 293 CHOCOLATE TRUFFLES MAKES 20-30 (DEPENDING ON SIZE) When you trim cakes to make the top level, you have some spare sponge that you can quickly blitz in a food processor to turn into crumbs. This recipe is inspired by one ofmyfirstjobs in a bakery, using up the off-cuts from cakes to make delicious little chocolate truffies. If you like, you can also use some crumbs to make a crisp outer coating. 150g dark chocolate ( 60- 70% cocoa solids), cut into small pieces 75gunsalted butter 150g cake crumbs 1-2 tbsp rum, brandy, amaretto, Grand Marnier or other liqueur of your choice (optional) For the crispy crumb coating (optional) 75gunsalted butter, melted 50g caster sugar 120g cake crumbs Alternative coatings About 2 tbsp sifted icing sugar, sifted cocoa powder or toasted desiccated coconut If you want to make the crispy crumb coating, heat your oven to 200°C/ Gas 6 and line a baking tray with baking parchment. Put the melted butter, sugar and cake crumbs into a bowl and mix until well combined, then spread out on a baking sheet and place in the oven for 15- 20 minutes, until the crumbs are crispy and golden brown; keep a close eye to make sure they don't get too brown and become bitter. Remove from the oven and leave to cool. Once cold, break up the crispy crumb into small breadcrumb-sized pieces, eitherusingyourfingers or by putting the mixture into a strong plastic bag and breaking it up with a rolling pin. To make the truffles, put the chocolate and butter into a heatproof bowl and set over a pan of simmering water, making sure the bowl is not touching the water. Leave until melted, then take the bowl off the heat, add the cake crumbs and mix well. Stir in 1 tbsp liqueur, if using; taste and add up to 1 tbsp more if you want a stronger flavour. Stir well, then leave until firm enough to mould. You can speed this up by putting the bowl into the fridge once cool enough. Set out 20-30 petit four cases on a baking tray or plate. Take heaped teaspoonfuls of the set truffle mix and roll into balls between your fingers. Roll the truffles in your choice of topping and place in the petit four cases. Store in an airtight container in a cool place and eat within 3 days.
